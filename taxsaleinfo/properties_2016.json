Please respect the privacy of current occupants and limit any inspection to what can be safely observed from the road. Some occupants may be upset or angry and may meet contact with aggression or violence. Please use discretion and caution when researching this or other occupied properties. Furthermore, although this property has been foreclosed for unpaid taxes, occupants have certain rights under Michigan law and must be formally evicted if unwilling to leave voluntarily. You may wish to consult a licensed attorney for more information. Our inspectors encountered aggressive dogs in the vicinity of this parcel. Please exercise caution if you choose to assess this property in person. One or more structures was boarded when we conducted our assessment of this parcel. Properties may be boarded for a variety of reasons. For example, properties are often boarded to prevent trespassers from harvesting copper plumbing, wiring, and other fixtures. Buildings may also be boarded by fire or other officials when they present a safety hazard. We generally do not enter boarded structures and limit our observations to the building's exterior. Likewise, you should limit any inspection of this property to its exterior only. You are not permitted to remove any boarding to view building interiors under any circumstances. Public property records or polite inquiries to neighbors may reveal additional information about a property's history. This parcel includes a structure which should be considered DANGEROUS. This building has suffered structural damage which creates substantial risk of harm from falling through damaged areas or collapse from above. It may also contain extensive debris which could fall or collapse, rusty nails, broken glass, and other hazards. You are not permitted to enter this or any other structure offered at tax sale. You should limit your inspection only to what can be safely observed from the building's exterior. Trespassers are subject to prosecution. The foundation of one or more buildings located on this parcel appears to be failing. Correcting foundation issues can be very expensive and issues are often more complex than they initially appear. You should research this issue thoroughly prior to bidding on this parcel. One or more buildings on this parcel has a roof which is either leaking to the interior or appears close to failure. Failing roofs often indicate substantial structural decay inside the building. You should investigate the integrity of this structure(s) prior to bidding. This property is unsanitary and poses a potential health hazard because of raw food garbage, backed up sewer lines, or other similar waste. Such conditions can attract rodents, wild animals, and other vermin. You should bid accordingly and be prepared to mitigate the situation immediately upon purchase.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/93797"},

{"title": "Two Story Home On Corner Lot Of Lulu St And Princeton Ave In Kalamazoo ", "comments": "The parcels in this sale unit are grouped, (\"bundled\") as permitted by MCL 211.78m. This bundle contains approximately 65 parcels of land. Many of these include structures which contain lead based paint. Some may contain asbestos. Many are in various stages of disrepair or collapse and are considered dangerous buildings and attractive nuisance. Some may be occupied by tenants-holding-over under law. These parcels are not being offered individually. They must be purchased as a single bundle at or above the minimum bid price, if any is stated. Pursuant to MCL 211.78 (1), the Foreclosing Governmental Unit (FGU) has determined that the most efficient and expeditious method to return many of these parcels to productive use, is to require their immediate demolition, remediation, rehabilitation or repurposing if sold at auction. Many of these parcels constitute blight, a public nuisance and abatement is considered necessary. Before their sale to ANY purchaser at auction, it is the intent of the FGU that any such purchaser shall demonstrate their financial ability and willingness to perform those actions necessary, in the public interest and welfare, to bring the properties into compliance with local codes and ordinances. Therefore, it is a further requirement of sale of the bundled properties that a purchaser must demolish, remediate, rehabilitate or repurpose these properties as follows: 1) ALL STRUCTURES must be secured and made un-enterable within 15 days of sale at auction, at the purchasers sole expense, or the sale shall be cancelled and no refund or deed issued. 2) Any visible refuse, garbage, trash or other cast off shall be removed from lands within 15 days of the sale at auction, at the purchasers sole expense, or the sale shall be cancelled and no refund or deed issued.. 3) The conditions required in (1) and (2) above shall be maintained against further entry or blight for a period of 12 months following the execution of a deed. 4) Those properties in the bundle that are beyond reasonable repair or economic vitality to repair must be demolished at the sole expense of the purchaser.

The performance bond shall be made out in favor of the Office of the Kalamazoo County Treasurer (acting as the Foreclosing Governmental Unit). Evidence of the issuance and full payment for such bond shall be presented to the FGU within fifteen (15) days of the acceptance of the purchasers bid at auction. In the event evidence of issuance and full payment is not tendered within fifteen (15) days of sale, the sale shall be cancelled outright, and the purchaser considered non-responsive to a necessary condition of the sale. No receipt for the sale shall be issued, and the bidder shall not be entitled to enter upon such premises, until such bond is issued and deemed sufficient by the FGU. Such bond shall be issued by an underwriter licensed to do business in the State of Michigan, who is not the subject of any pending disciplinary action by the State of Michigan or any department, bureau or commission thereof. It shall be payable, in full amount, to the FGU in the event of either whole or partial non-performance of the terms above written for its entire duration.

One or more structures was boarded when we conducted our assessment of this parcel. Properties may be boarded for a variety of reasons. For example, properties are often boarded to prevent trespassers from harvesting copper plumbing, wiring, and other fixtures.

You should confirm the status of this parcel as well as the allocation of the cost of demolition prior to bidding. This parcel includes a structure which should be considered DANGEROUS. This building has suffered structural damage which creates substantial risk of harm from falling through damaged areas or collapse from above. It may also contain extensive debris which could fall or collapse, rusty nails, broken glass, and other hazards. You are not permitted to enter this or any other structure offered at tax sale. You should limit your inspection only to what can be safely observed from the building's exterior. Trespassers are subject to prosecution. This property appears as if it may be a side-yard parcel. Frequently homes are located on one parcel and the associated back or side-yard is located on a separate adjacent parcel. These side-yards are sometimes foreclosed while the home is not. This can create unfortunate situations where fenced boundaries, septic tanks, out buildings, garages, and other improvements that were previously associated with the home next door are sold on their own. Such parcels may have value to the adjacent owners but often have little to no value on their own. You should investigate this parcel carefully and understand what you are purchasing before you bid.

This parcel has been posted as \"Condemned\" by the local building authority. Properties are generally condemned when they are deemed substandard, unsafe, or otherwise unfit for use and habitation. Condemned property must be rehabilitated to meet local building codes prior to use or occupancy. A building is not automatically slated for demolition when condemned.

Such buildings may be subject to condemnation orders which we were unable to locate during our inspection.

Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property. Pet and/or wild animal waste was observed within this property. Potential bidders should consider that urine stains/odors can be difficult to remove from porous surfaces such as wood floors or underlayment. This home was occupied on last visit.

{"title": "The Hotel Barnes. Manistique", "comments": "This is a historic, 20+ room hotel property in downtown Manistique, that in recent years was used only as a bar and quasi-boarding house. This could become an exciting boutique hotel project for someone with deep pockets looking for a calling in a small town ... or it could become a money pit for an unwary buyer. Structurally, this building seems very sound and square to us. It has a bad roof over the rear 20 feet or so of the building, but much of the rest of it is in decent repair structurally and it appears that the roof has been maintained in the entire forward section until recently. The buyer of this property needs to quickly repair the roof, manage the collection of gutter and downspout discharge, and repair the rear wall. There is a washout happening on the rear facade, which requires the immediate attention of a brick mason, or this one will be beyond feasible economic repair in another 2-3 years. Mechanically, this building has a fairly new boiler and newer looking electric service and and hot water heater, but the rest of it is a start-over. What mechanicals remain have either been stripped/harvested for scrap or are antiquated and nowhere near function (or code) anymore. The last guy that bought this at our sale disregarded our comments about its condition, and now we have it back again. If you're looking at this one, please understand that it needs a lot of elbow grease, soon. This is not a \"flip\" for a passive investor at all. The potential here is endless, but it will require the same from you in commitment. Three floors. Lobby, restaurant/tavern room. Kitchen. One or more buildings on this parcel has a roof which is either leaking to the interior or appears close to failure. Failing roofs often indicate substantial structural decay inside the building.

There is still personal property here that remains titled in the former owner. A neighbor is watching this one .. so please do not enter it ... we have it posted for a reason.

The road runs parallel with the west boundary of the parcel for about the last 300 feet, and then veers left onto a somewhat mucky trail that runs along the north line of the parcel. We found a recent power service here as well as a hand driven shallow well with pump. There is a culvert when you pull into the property that we'd recommend not crossing with a regular auto, lest you get stuck. The property is well wooded and does not show signs of recent harvest. We survey a fair amount of maple here, as well as poplar and other softwoods. The property rolls gradually downhill to the west, where the border of the property fronts along O'Neil Creek pretty much along its entire west boundary. The topo maps do not indicate there being wetlands here, but it's probably got some wetlands indicators into the west half as the elevation drops toward the creek. There is a good amount of \"man junk\" here that you'll need to dispose of. Much of it will probably burn, but there is also a pretty good pile of scrap metal and tires here also. We didn't see anything that points to potential contamination, but its clear that the past use of the property has including some random dumping, so you should take a real good look around if you're interested in this one. It has a street address, well and power ... so it has probably been used at least as a camp, and there may have been (or could still be) something more than just the campers here that have been used for occupancy. This is a private road, not maintained by the county, and you may have trouble getting back here in a non 4WD vehicle in the winter. There are year rounders on the road a couple thousand feet toward civilization .... so you'll need your own snowplow ...", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/90822"},

Great little house in a well kept neighborhood. This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property.

Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address.

Please contact the Treasurers office or auction house for complete details.** There are two units on this lot. The larger, front one has been boarded up to keep all the goodness inside. Or maybe to keep the pigeons out. Either way, we did not view the interior and she is closed up tight ... probably by local authorities. We assume this has been condemned by the city building offficial, and that reuse would require it be brought to current building code, which could be a formidable task. The structure is a \"Biltmore\", and has several additions to the rear and side, some of which are leaning and weaving suggesting foundation issues. To the rear is a one story \"mother in law\" unit that is actually in pretty decent overall condition, but could still use some cosmetic updating to the exterior. Inside it has knotty pine, and has an updated (90's-ish) bath and kitchen. Newer forced air natural gas heat. Roof is not new, but does not appear to be a leaker. This is a two-for-one deal, but you have to demolish both of them. This parcel has been posted as \"Condemned\" by the local building authority. Properties are generally condemned when they are deemed substandard, unsafe, or otherwise unfit for use and habitation. Condemned property must be rehabilitated to meet local building codes prior to use or occupancy. A building is not automatically slated for demolition when condemned. However, this does not necessarily mean that demolition will not also be pursued by the local unit.

{"title": "Commercial Property Used For Residence. Bark River", "comments": "This is an older frame construction building that is located in \"downtown\" Bark River, just off US-2. The front face has been vinyl sided over the old plate glass storefront facade. The other 3 sides are pretty much left untouched since their last, mid-century upgrade with asphalt shingle siding. There is a steel roof on the two story portion of the building. Inside, the main floor is spartan and plain. We noticed springy floors in the center of the main floor. It appears that it may have been used as a restaurant, although the sign out front says \"Video &amp; Tanning\". The second floor is actually most of the way through a remodel, and much of the material to finish it is onsite. There is standing water ... probably a couple of feet worth ... in the basement (No power = no sump pump) that will need to be removed. The elcectric service here is substantial, 200 amp, but it's all discombobulated and will need a review by qualified personnel. We suspect that the plan here was probably to convert the entire building to residential. The building on this property appears to have been used for multi-family occupancy in the past based upon indicators such as multiple mailboxes, entrances, numbering, layout, or other such factors. Modifications to the property may NOT have been legally made and may NOT conform to local zoning. Prospective bidders should verify with local officials that multi-family use is permitted under existing zoning. In many areas, once a multi-family use has been discontinued, it cannot be reinstated unless in conformance with local zoning and code. The previous owner of this parcel undertook a construction or rehabilitation project which has not been completed. We have attempted to describe the degree to which the project has been finished, but the building should be be considered incomplete nonetheless.

The floor in the living room is very springy, and has some pretty serious dips and bowing going on. One spot caved in and is now covered with a board to prevent someone from falling through. This also has transmitted itself to other areas of the house including a second floor door that will not open because the jamb is out of square. Someone will probably need to lift this entire house up and put a new support system underneath it in order to make it merchantable. it would never pass an inspection in its current condition.

There are warning signs on the property that threaten trespassers with \"traps\", so we would suggest due care be used when viewing this property. It was unoccupied (we think) when we were there in early June, but it's difficult to say if the former owner/occupant is still around here or if they've left for greener pastures. The power is still on, so that's questionable. There was previously a modular home here, and we assume there are a fairly modern well and septic that have potential for reuse. The SEV noted is a couple of years old ... and the property is now assessed under $2000. There is some debris here to reckon with. Level, wooded dry lands. Just a couple miles up the road from the LVD Casino on a recreational area, gravel, county maintained road. Would be a nice spot for a getaway or new home. Few year-rounders in the immediate area.

Much of the interior of the bar and house is knotty pine. The home to the rear is in comparable repair. The roof of the attached garage to the north has some noticeable sway to it, but it has likely been like that for years.

These buildings first served as housing for mine workers, their families, and those in supporting local business during the last half of last century. When the mine closed, they transitioned to rental housing for those who stayed behind ... and then gradually fell vacant and into disrepair. The buildings are substantial, having almost a military housing grade of infrastructure to them. The floor decking on the main level is reinforced concrete, and the mechanical systems are hefty and elaborate for their time in this place. Each housing unit is separately wired to its own individual panelboard, but each building only has one power service. Because the individual units are fed from the basement level (which is underwater) we can't be sure if it is individually sub-metered. Sale 5110 is the more \"original\" of the two buildings, and we suspect it has been vacant longer, perhaps well over a decade. Unlike 5109, the roof has not been leaking for an extended period time, but we trust that is a short term situation at best. We aren't sure of their exact age, but we do know these buildings predate 1978. There is a high probability that the buildings contain either/both lead based paint and asbestos wrap on steam pipes in the corridor ceilings and basement level. The basement here is nearly full ... at least 5 foot in depth ... with water (power offf = no sump pump). We also noticed mold creeping up the main floor walls here, and some \"harvesting\" has been taking place of scrap metal (radiators etc). It will require \"deep pockets\" to restore this building to a code-approvable multi-family residential use. Are there other options ? It could possibly be used for storage or warehousing at a much lower cost, but with a similarly low return. This building exhibited more decay to the exterior surfaces that 5109, but that may be simply because the other unit has some more recent effort made at cosmetics. This property appears to include one or more obsolete structures. Due to changed circumstances, physical conditions, or the passage of time, structures can become economically unviable. Such changes may be related to physical condition but may also be the result of things like changed traffic patterns or local economic distress. Prospective bidders should be aware that this property may no longer be suitable for purposes to which it was previously put and should investigate and consider all circumstances prior to bidding.

The roof doesn't look too hot, but we did not see any signs of leakage inside. Again, the foundation here is going to be a major defect to correct, so most other conditions are secondary. You will want to assess the condition of the foundation here carefully before bidding. The foundation of one or more buildings located on this parcel appears to be failing.

{"title": "Home In Need Of Help. Crystal Falls", "comments": "This home has a failing foundation, which could preclude it from economic vitality as a candidate for restoration without a serious, and immediate effort to correct it (see photos). The basement foundation wall is already leaning, and has a major stress crack that indicates it could probably fail and collapse inward at any time. It needs a roof and a complete interior redo. It does have a newer electric service, older furnace, original kitchen and bath. The home is worthy of rehabilitating, but you're going to need to assess the foundation situation before making that decision. There are 5 bedrooms here. The previous owner of this parcel undertook a construction or rehabilitation project which has not been completed. We have attempted to describe the degree to which the project has been finished, but the building should be be considered incomplete nonetheless. The local building code enforcement official may be able to offer additional insight as to why the project was never completed.

From the exterior, the left side building appears to be solid, straight and square.

The building to the right is also two story, and the two are corrected inside on the main floor and by a hallway or some similar connection across the front of the second floor. The roofs here are quite old rolled roofing, and there are ladders visible which infers an ongoing battle has been underway to keep them from leaking. This property is occupied.

An exterior concrete block structure has been built to enclose an exterior stair to the living space above the bar room. The second floor was a remodel-in-progress which was unfinished.

The roof appears newer and merchantable, but the siding, doors and windows are all ancient. You'll be able to spot this house on this densely populated street, because its the only one with a hearse in the yard. We did not have the opportunity to view the house up close and personal, but we're told it has strong \"animal odors\", and has a healthy population of felines in residence. This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property. This property is occupied. Please respect the privacy of current occupants and limit any inspection to what can be safely observed from the road. Some occupants may be upset or angry and may meet contact with aggression or violence. Please use discretion and caution when researching this or other occupied properties. Furthermore, although this property has been foreclosed for unpaid taxes, occupants have certain rights under Michigan law and must be formally evicted if unwilling to leave voluntarily. You may wish to consult a licensed attorney for more information. Pet and/or wild animal waste was observed within this property.

This was probably a sharp home in its day, but that ship sailed a while ago. The front porch columns have been replaced with ill fitting 4x4 posts (themselves in disrepair). The inside has become a haven for pigeons, and we scared up a bunch of them when we opened the door. Inside, the floors have all warped up from the bad roof. It has the original staircases, but most of the wood trim was removed during a 70-ish \"updating\". The foundation is buckling inside the basement. This one is past it's ninth life already ... One or more buildings on this parcel has a roof which is either leaking to the interior or appears close to failure. Failing roofs often indicate substantial structural decay inside the building. You should investigate the integrity of this structure(s) prior to bidding. The foundation of one or more buildings located on this parcel appears to be failing. Correcting foundation issues can be very expensive and issues are often more complex than they initially appear. You should research this issue thoroughly prior to bidding on this parcel. This parcel includes a structure which should be considered DANGEROUS. This building has suffered structural damage which creates substantial risk of harm from falling through damaged areas or collapse from above. It may also contain extensive debris which could fall or collapse, rusty nails, broken glass, and other hazards. You are not permitted to enter this or any other structure offered at tax sale. You should limit your inspection only to what can be safely observed from the building's exterior. Trespassers are subject to prosecution.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/89811"},
{"title": "\"better Than It Appears From The Outside\" Mobile And Detached 2 Car Garage. Watersmeet", "comments": "Older roofover mobile home in Watersmeet. Has been reroofed and resided, but needs cosmetic guidance. The skirting is in disarray, and it looks like the plumbing has been pulled apart in places inferring freeze damage. Inside, this one is a real fooler. From the outside you could easily discount it as another cruddy old mobile. But it actually has been nicely upgraded inside and is probably functional with just a little work. Most of the effort here will be restoring the mechanicals, and making the exterior more appealing. The garage is much more substantial, being built out of 6x6 timber. It has an overhead door that needs to be properly trimmed out, but it appears to have potential for rehabilitation and continued use.

We cannot be certain of the condition of the well or septic system, but we are confident that the roof is shot. This one has suffered neglect for some time. However all that being said, it is in remarkably better ccondition than many of its age we have seen. The interior is knotty pine and appears to generally be salvagable. There is some evidence of critters being in the attic and making their way through the ceiling, but this too, is recoverable. Curiously, the turlet is on the front porch, so we assume the septic (what there is of it) is to the left, and the well is in the pit to the right. In the right hands, this could be a charmer. In other hands, it would be a great place for a garage or addition for a neighbor. NOTE: The structure on this property has had a condemnation order placed on it since 2011.

{"title": "Occupied Home In Lincoln Village", "comments": "This is an older, two story classic architecture home in Lincoln Village. The roof on the main part of the home is newer architectural shingle, but other parts are older and different colors. Because it is occupied, we did not have the opportunity to view the property in detail. 2 car detached garage. The occupant is likely a tenant or purchaser on unrecorded land contract. This is a quaint home and has some potential with the right rehab effort. At present there is a good amount of visible wear and tear to the exterior that should be attended to. Has a vacant sidelot parcel that has been used as a garden in the past years. The interior of this property was not viewed during our inspection. Buildings which are dangerous, occupied, boarded, condemned, or otherwise difficult to enter are inspected from the exterior/curbside only. You are NOT authorized to enter these or any other buildings offered for sale. You should limit your inspection to that which can be made safely from the building's exterior. This property is occupied. Please respect the privacy of current occupants and limit any inspection to what can be safely observed from the road. Some occupants may be upset or angry and may meet contact with aggression or violence. Please use discretion and caution when researching this or other occupied properties. Furthermore, although this property has been foreclosed for unpaid taxes, occupants have certain rights under Michigan law and must be formally evicted if unwilling to leave voluntarily. You may wish to consult a licensed attorney for more information.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/88841"},
{"title": "33' Wide X 200' Deep Strip Of Land.", "comments": "Parcel is 33' wide and runs from road, then east 200 feet. A great location for lawn bowling. Likely too small for any purpose other than lawn bowling or maybe a garden. This parcel is what we refer to as a 33'/66'. We frequently see foreclosed parcels that are either 33 or 66 feet wide. These parcels are often a result of existing or former road rights of way. A common road right of way is 66 feet wide. Half of that is 33 feet. There are two common scenarios that we see. Scenario 1: A land owner splits a tract of land and creates a common easement parcel for access. They might then quit paying taxes on the parcel with road frontage knowing that the easement would remain even after foreclosure. Such easements are generally either 33 or 66 feet wide. Scenario 2: Rural land generally runs to the center of any public road on which it fronts whereas subdivided land usually runs to the edge of the road right-of-way. Sometimes during surveys or other splits, half of the right-of-way (usually 33 feet) can become orphaned, effectively turning to no-man's-land. Potential bidders should be aware that 33 and 66 foot wide parcels are very likely to include easements. That means that there are people who have a right to use the property even though they do not own the land. It is unlawful to cut off access over a 33 or 66 foot parcel where an easement already exists. Even if an easement doesn't already exists, courts will frequently create such an easement to prevent a neighboring parcel from becoming landlocked. Potential bidders should consider that this parcel likely has little value and cannot be used to landlock a neighboring parcel when there is no other path for ingress and egress. This parcel is too small to be practically useful under most circumstances. Many times such parcels are the result of survey or property transfer errors which create small orphaned slivers of land. These parcels are frequently too small to allow construction or any other practical use. They often have no road frontage or legal means of access. These parcels can often lead to adverse claims or encroachments by neighboring land owners which can be complicated legal issues to resolve. Please investigate this parcel thoroughly prior to bidding.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/88840"},

{"title": "Wow! Very Nice Late Century Cottage Near Hubbard Lake!", "comments": "This is a late 20th century cottage in a subdivision that we are told has shared access to Hubbard Lake. You will want to verify that information if it is important to you. The interior features cedar walls and ceiling. Central air. Skylights. A light and bright home, with views of the lake from the living room and expansive deck. The power that runs the sump pump in the basement is off, and this has caused some water to collect in the basement level, which is unfinished. Unless properly managed, this can cause molding. We are also told that the former owner complained of mold issues, so there may need to be some remediation and preventative planning done to manage this when the home is \"closed up\" for extended periods. The roof has some buildup of moss which should be promptly addressed. Someone (for whatever reason) discharged several fire extinguishers around the outside of this home before they left ... we are unsure why. There is a detached, one car garage here that could easily double as a studio or workshop. The property is nicely landscaped, and partly furnished. We remind viewers that personal property is not sold as part of the offering and still belongs to the former owner of the property. The well for this home is in a pit in the detached garage, and appears serviceable. A beautiful little hideaway in the woods near the lake. This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/88826"},

The building appears to need a new roof over the one story area (about 500 square feet), but the roof over the two story bay area seems to be good at present. There is a small amount of refuse to get rid of inside including a couple dozen tires. There are two auto bays here with 10x10 overhead doors, and the interior area has floor drains. There are no signs of there having been lifts or oil change pits. The Michigan Environmental mapper suggests that this parcel has two underground storage tanks still in the ground. You may wish to verify this information for yourself on the attached link. We did notice two hooded vent pipes on the front of the building to the right and left sides of the showroom that look an awful lot like a UST vent ... but no other outward signs that there might be tanks still here. So that condition should be verified. Note that while the Enviromapper suggests there may be still be tanks here, it is LISTED as being a contaminated site. The purchaser of this property will need to license or remove the remaining tanks, and a baseline environmental assessment is highly recommended within 45 days of purchase to limit your potential liability if any problems turn up in the future. See more detail at : http://www.deq.state.mi.us/sid-web/Tank_Detail.aspx?mod=ust&amp;mode=CGI&amp;Facility_ID=00007559 This is a substantial, prime piece of East Jordan commercial real estate The building has been an auto parts store and a mechanics garage among other uses in the past. Has newer, substantial electric service. This sale includes two adjacent parcels This parcel may contain buried storage tanks from previous use as a gas station or similar enterprise. Our analysis is based solely on visual inspection of the property surface as further detailed in the lot description. The State of Michigan may require a new owner to remove any remaining tanks and remediate environmental concerns at their sole expense. Additional information may be available from the MDEQ Storage Tank Database. You should conduct careful and thorough research prior to bidding on this parcel.

It is your responsibility to determine whether a parcel is suitable for your desired purpose. Our review of this parcel indicates that the noted State Equalized Value (SEV) does not appear to reflect the current value of the property. This is often due to buildings or other improvements being demolished or fire damaged or other similar items included in the SEV being removed from the property. It can also be due to market changes in the area in which the property is located. It should be further noted that the SEV/assessed value of the parcel as noted in this listing may be several years old.

Milton Township", "comments": "This is a teenty-tiny sliver of land, about 100 feet long east-to-west, at thew SW corner of the intersection of Cherry Avenue and Eagles Way Lane. It is 36 feet wide at its widest (west) end, and narrows to nothing at the intersection. It's an election year ... maybe you can put a sign on it. Other than that ... This parcel is too small to be practically useful under most circumstances. Many times such parcels are the result of survey or property transfer errors which create small orphaned slivers of land. These parcels are frequently too small to allow construction or any other practical use. They often have no road frontage or legal means of access. These parcels can often lead to adverse claims or encroachments by neighboring land owners which can be complicated legal issues to resolve.

{"title": "Roofover Mobile And Garage In Lakes Of The North Near Mancelona", "comments": "We are selling 3 lots (sale #357, 358 and 359) as a unit. These lots contain an older roofover mobile home with stick built addition, as well as a detached two car garage. This property is still under the control, use and occupancy of the former owners until July 15th. It appears to be in overall good condition, and was occupied through the winter which means there is probably not any frozen plumbing situation ... but that's not guaranteed. The structures here are in serviceable condition, but will need some scrubbing and minor repair. The last occupants here were renters, and they didn't do much in the way of taking all of their castoffs with them when they left. This is located in Lakes of the North, which is a development that is under the auspices of the Lakes of the North Property Owners Association. We have linked to their website, and you will want to refer to that information for details in fees, POA amenities and restrictions. This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property. This parcel is likely subject to ASSOCIATION FEES which are assessed to cover maintenance and other costs associated with the development in which the parcel is located.

The land here is sandy soils, level and fairly open, with a very wide assortment of vegetation sparsely scattered across the parcel. One or more structures was boarded when we conducted our assessment of this parcel. Properties may be boarded for a variety of reasons. For example, properties are often boarded to prevent trespassers from harvesting copper plumbing, wiring, and other fixtures. Buildings may also be boarded by fire or other officials when they present a safety hazard. We generally do not enter boarded structures and limit our observations to the building's exterior. Likewise, you should limit any inspection of this property to its exterior only. You are not permitted to remove any boarding to view building interiors under any circumstances. Public property records or polite inquiries to neighbors may reveal additional information about a property's history. The interior of this property was not viewed during our inspection. Buildings which are dangerous, occupied, boarded, condemned, or otherwise difficult to enter are inspected from the exterior/curbside only.

{"title": "4 Unit Residential Property At Schuss Mountain! Family Or Corporate Retreat ... Or Great Income / Investment Property!", "comments": "This property was built in the early 1990's and has been used its entire life as a timeshare rental property with literally dozens of investor-owners, but controlled by a timeshare management company. It is a 4 unit property, however they are individually deeded, and NOT condominium units. Thus, there is no existing agreement in place that would provide for the maintenance of the exterior or common elements of the property if each unit had a different owner. For that reason, we are offering this property as a single sale unit. Each unit is 2 bedrooms and 1 bath, with a kitchenette and balcony or patio. 2 units are \"garden level\" and two are on the second floor and have slightly vaulted ceilings. We are told that the property in the past was maintained by the resorts housekeeping and maintenance staff and underwent some substantial repair and refreshing within the last 3 or 4 years. It has been wholly vacant since about June of 2014. To our eyes, this building looks to be in overall excellent condition, though it is a wee bit dated and could stand some freshening up. There are furnishings in the units, but it is rather spartan, and on the grade of mid-line hotel furnishing. Each unit is separately metered for heat and electricity. If you have been looking for a family retreat for siblings or children, a corporate retreat, or an investment or income property, look no further. This is a seldom seen property type in our experience. The units are, by deed covenant, part of the Sudendorf Property Owners Association, at a cost of $184 PER MONTH PER UNIT. In other words, $732/month for the whole building (Note: The association dues were previously listed here as $314 per year in this description, which was incorrect). That covers use of the pool, firewood for the in-unit fireplace, and driveway snow removal. We are including photos of the exterior, followed by the individual units (note the unit number on each door for demarcation). This parcel is likely subject to ASSOCIATION FEES which are assessed to cover maintenance and other costs associated with the development in which the parcel is located. Interested parties should verify the existence and extent of association fees and costs prior to bidding. Being sold with unit 318. Please see that listing Being sold with unit 318.

{"title": "Great Townhouse At Schuss Mountain Resort!", "comments": "We have offered several properties at Schuss Mountain over the years, but this is the first time we have sold a detached, stand-alone unit in great condition. This is a single family unit on a private lot, and not a condo. No noisy TVs on the other side of the wall or people taking all the good parking spots like at the condos ... you have it all to yourself.This cottage has 3 bedrooms and 2 baths. Fireplace, private deck out back and a spiral staircase leading to the upper floor. In the past, this unit was involved with the rental program here as a timeshare, and it was regularly maintained and housekeeping duty was performed by resort staff. It was updated periodically, but this unit has never been anyones sole and exclusive unit, and as such it lacks the attention and character that a user-owner could create. The roof here is older, and is likely in the last few years of usefulness. The interior is merchantable, but as you'll see in the photos, it's a bit dated and worn. This offers offers great potential as an user-owner property, or as an investment vehicle if put into the rental management program. This unit has been out of the rental program, and unoccupied since the spring of 2014. We're not sure of the purposer, but the sign on the front of the unit says \"3752\" ... that's neither it's address or a unit number ... but could be a \"room number\" assigned by the resort. Last occupancy here was approximately June of 2014.This unit is, by deed covenant, part of the Sudendorf Property Owners Association, at a cost of $184 per MONTH (Note: The association dues were previously listed here as $314 per year in this description, which was incorrect).

It is at the bottom of a sandy hill access road that AAA might not pull you out of, so be careful here if visiting. There is no power or other utility service here.

This parcel is accessible by a road that is believed to be a seasonal or non-maintained public road. While we make no representations or warranties as to the precise nature of such road access, our research suggests that this road is either 1) Not regularly graded; and/or 2) Not snow plowed in winters; and/or 3) Appears subject to fallen trees or other events which have not been addressed by the county road commission. You should conduct your own research into this issue prior to bidding. Our visual inspection indicated that electrical service was not available on or near this parcel.

A power line crosses the property midway up the driveway, which then climbs a rather steep hill to the location of (what's left of) a mobile home that we surmise was scrapped. The frame and axles remain for easy removal ... but you'll want new tires. Could also become a great float in the local parade. The top of the lot is nearly level with the tips of the trees at roadside. It's quite a scenic perch away from passersby on the road. There is a well and power service on this property, and we assume a septic too. You may wish to check with the district health department as to whether they meet current requirements for re-use.

Maps and GPS will show other ways to get \"in\" to this parcel, but the only reliable way we found was off Wilke Road from the South and west, and then following E Ford Road, a winding shared easement road, 3/4s of a mile or so to another driveway-like two track that runs to the north and west of a mobile home and then continues in the woods to the north. Once you reach the property, there is a road that comes into it from the west about halfway up that boundary and runs to a couple of campspots toward the center of the parcel. We did not find any roads into the east half of the lot. There is a camper here that we do not have title to ... and its not a part of the sale. Power is over 500 feet away. The north line of this property (marked along the two track at the west boundary) is Federal National Forest property. Hundreds or even thousands of acres of it.

Sometimes they are adjacent (ie: a home on one lot and it's well or septic on another parcel) and other times they are bundled because they have issues that should be addressed prior to being sold individually. This group is from the latter category. In this bundle we have a gas station with ground contamination and underground tanks that need to be removed, parcels that are too small to build on, parcels that have no legal access and other problems. In order to be awarded the bid for this bundle, the successful bidder will be required to post a performance bond that assures FULL REMEDIATION of the contamination at the gas station property and the removal of the underground storage tanks. The site is listed with the MIDEQ Environmental mapper as \"Facility #9017\". There is an open file on contamination (Leak ID: C-0116-05) from the release of gasoline, and there are two tanks still in the ground, one being 2000 gallons and the other 6000 gallons. A bidder will be required to provide suitable proof of an issued performance bond and evicence of a plan to remediate and remove within 21 days of the auction, or the sale will be cancelled without refund, and no deed will be issued. No possession of the property will be granted until issuance of the deed on this sale. Please contact the auction house if you have further questions. This parcel may contain buried storage tanks from previous use as a gas station or similar enterprise. Our analysis is based solely on visual inspection of the property surface as further detailed in the lot description. The State of Michigan may require a new owner to remove any remaining tanks and remediate environmental concerns at their sole expense. Additional information may be available from the MDEQ Storage Tank Database. You should conduct careful and thorough research prior to bidding on this parcel. A visual inspection of this parcel indicates potential environmental contamination. Visual indicators can include things like used tires, dirty soils, or chemically intensive former uses such as dry cleaning. Prospective bidders should carefully research the condition of this property prior to bidding. You may with to contact the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality or other relevant state agencies for additional guidance. Purchasers are strongly advised to obtain a Baseline Environmental Assessment (BEA). Some basic information about BEA can be found here.

There are several buildings here, including a \"Biltmore\" home, garage, several small sheds and a metal storage building that may be the best thing on the lot. There is a considerable amount of castoff here, and you'll be friends with the people at the dumpster company by the time you're done cleaning this one up. The nucleus of the residential unit is a modular/manufactured housing unit with several rambling additions. The decking is bowing and weaving and will probably need replacement, but the structure itself seems sound and restorable ... just lots of debris. Be aware, however, that they took part of it with them (breakers, some of the wiring has been \"harvested\"). 3 Bedrooms and a full basement here. The storage building is solid and has a concrete floor ... it too has lots of debris to be hauled off. All of the power services to this property have been dropped by the electric provider. This one has potential to be cleaned up and brought back to life. It has had some rough use, but has a lot of life left. This parcel appears to have been subject to harvesting of electrical, plumbing, mechanical systems, or other building components. Buildings are sometimes targeted by criminals that steal or \"harvest\" items such as copper plumbing, wiring, furnaces, water heaters, fixtures, hardwood flooring, etc. This building should be considered incomplete due to such harvesting and may require substantial investment to reequip.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/90865"},

There is a lot of poured concrete here ... it will be here after we are all long gone. Has an attached solarium/greenhouse room that will also need some work. It is difficult to say whether this moisture issue can be controlled by HVAC, a water collection system around the perimeter, or whether excavation and re-sealing will be required.

{"title": "40 Acres In The Solon Swamp!", "comments": "Looking for a gift for that person that has everything ? How about 40 acres in the heart of the Solon swamp ? This is a square 40, 1320x1320, and the most efficient way to get to it is probably by water ... as it is about 1500 feet from South Lake Leelanau. There are no roads into this area (you'd sink), and power is thousands of feet from here. It is unlikely that there is any buildable portion of this property ... so its highest and best use is recreational and hunting land. There is likely a small fortune here in cedar (pun intended), but you'd be challenged getting it out of there. Also, it is quite likely that the property has no access. We would strongly suggest a detailed investigation of easement rights. This parcel has surface water, soil, or vegetation conditions indicating that it may include wetland habitat. Such habitat may comprise all or part of the parcel's area. However, it is possible that this parcel contains buildable areas as well. There are many environmental and building regulations related to wetlands which you should consult before bidding on this parcel. It is your responsibility to determine if this parcel is suitable for your desired use. Our visual inspection indicated that electrical service was not available on or near this parcel. The nearest electric service appeared to be a considerable distance (hundreds or perhaps thousands of feet) from the property. As such, electrifying this parcel could be costly.

{"title": "Forty Acres In Leelanau County!", "comments": "Bring your checkbooks, folks. This one will be highly sought after ! 40 acres near Gilbert Lake, 1.5 miles north of the Benzie County line in Kasson Township. The property has no direct road frontage on maintained streets, but has a 33' shared driveway easement off South Gilbert Road. The easement road is along the north line of the properties that share it, an just north of a fenced orchard area. The approximate west line of the parcel is most of the way down a steep hill on this rroad ... which was deeply rutted and not passable by vehicle ... when we were there in late June. The lands here are wooded and rolling ... with a maximum terrain change of about 30m (100 feet) from its highest points near the north line to the lowest at the SE corner. USGS topographical maps do not indicate there being any marshlands here. This is a VERY private location and would make a stellar camp or hunting spot in additional to much potential as an estate parcel. Property is well wooded and someone spent some moolah putting a gravel road in here that, with proper maintenance, will be sufficient access for this parcel. 39.9 acres calculated.

{"title": "Older 1.5 Story Home In Maple City.", "comments": "This bundle of 4 properties has the following requirements for purchase: The purchaser will be required to demolish the house and garage located on parcel 007-002-035-00 at their own cost within 60 days of the sale. Prior to deed delivery, the purchaser will be required to furnish a personal guarantee and performance bond in the amount of $35,000 to assure this demolition or the land will revert back to county ownership. The performance bond and personal guarantee funding can be used for the demolition costs. Please contact the Treasurers office or auction house for complete details. The previous owner of this parcel undertook a construction or rehabilitation project which has not been completed. We have attempted to describe the degree to which the project has been finished, but the building should be be considered incomplete nonetheless. The local building code enforcement official may be able to offer additional insight as to why the project was never completed. This property appears to lie within (under) the right-of-way of North Manitou Trail, which is also known as \"North Omigisi Beach Road\" locally. It is roughly 66' wide (the width of a road) x 625+ feet east to west.There are two things we can tell you based on that: (1) You can't build on a parcel that others have a r/o/w over, and (2) You can't prevent those with that right, from using it. Short version is that this parcel is probably only really of value to those who use the r/o/w over it ... and they can do that without paying the taxes ... so that's probably why we have it ! It may hold some other limited potential (bird houses ? laundry line ? outdoor bowling ?) but we'd urge you to consider the investment carefully prior to bidding. This parcel is too small to be practically useful under most circumstances. Many times such parcels are the result of survey or property transfer errors which create small orphaned slivers of land. These parcels are frequently too small to allow construction or any other practical use. They often have no road frontage or legal means of access. These parcels can often lead to adverse claims or encroachments by neighboring land owners which can be complicated legal issues to resolve. Please investigate this parcel thoroughly prior to bidding. This parcel is what we refer to as a 33'/66'. We frequently see foreclosed parcels that are either 33 or 66 feet wide. These parcels are often a result of existing or former road rights of way. A common road right of way is 66 feet wide. Half of that is 33 feet. There are two common scenarios that we see. Scenario 1: A land owner splits a tract of land and creates a common easement parcel for access. They might then quit paying taxes on the parcel with road frontage knowing that the easement would remain even after foreclosure. Such easements are generally either 33 or 66 feet wide. Scenario 2: Rural land generally runs to the center of any public road on which it fronts whereas subdivided land usually runs to the edge of the road right-of-way. Sometimes during surveys or other splits, half of the right-of-way (usually 33 feet) can become orphaned, effectively turning to no-man's-land. Potential bidders should be aware that 33 and 66 foot wide parcels are very likely to include easements. That means that there are people who have a right to use the property even though they do not own the land. It is unlawful to cut off access over a 33 or 66 foot parcel where an easement already exists. Even if an easement doesn't already exists, courts will frequently create such an easement to prevent a neighboring parcel from becoming landlocked. Potential bidders should consider that this parcel likely has little value and cannot be used to landlock a neighboring parcel when there is no other path for ingress and egress. This is a vacant parcel of irregular shape, and part of an abandon railroad r/o/w on the north cul-de-sac end of N. Dawn Haven Road. It may or may not have legal access from that road. 102' feet on the south, east and west lines, and 51' feet on the north side. Located just south of Northport, off M-22. There is a powerline r/o/w at the north end, and we see some wetlands indicators, but it rises in topography away fom the road. That being said, this is also an old railroad right-of-way, and there may be further impact of setbacks under zoning on a 51' parcel .... If you're interested in this one, walk it carefully and maybe consider having it surveyed or otherwise \"make sure you know what you're bidding on\". This is a parcel of land that lies to the west/southwest of South Ridgeview Trail, west of the Nabawnaga Shores plat. It is hillside topography and may have no legal access from the road depending on its exact location and the road r/o/w path. We'd suggest close investigation and perhaps a survey if you are interested in this one.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/90784"},

Potential bidders should consider that urine stains/odors can be difficult to remove from porous surfaces such as wood floors or underlayment. The building on this property appears to have been used for multi-family occupancy in the past based upon indicators such as multiple mailboxes, entrances, numbering, layout, or other such factors. Modifications to the property may NOT have been legally made and may NOT conform to local zoning. Prospective bidders should verify with local officials that multi-family use is permitted under existing zoning. In many areas, once a multi-family use has been discontinued, it cannot be reinstated unless in conformance with local zoning and code. One or more buildings on this parcel has a roof which is either leaking to the interior or appears close to failure. Failing roofs often indicate substantial structural decay inside the building. You should investigate the integrity of this structure(s) prior to bidding.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/92060"},

Close to house. 1/2 of a lot This parcel is located within a municipality which monitors property maintenance and condition. You may be assessed fees and fines if you fail to mow the grass or do not otherwise properly maintain the property after purchase. One advantage to these parcels is that they typically have infrastructure nearby (water, sewer, power). However, you should confirm the availability of such utilities as well as the connection costs prior to bidding. It is your responsibility to determine whether a parcel is suitable for your desired purpose. This property appears as if it may be a side-yard parcel. Frequently homes are located on one parcel and the associated back or side-yard is located on a separate adjacent parcel. These side-yards are sometimes foreclosed while the home is not. This can create unfortunate situations where fenced boundaries, septic tanks, out buildings, garages, and other improvements that were previously associated with the home next door are sold on their own. Such parcels may have value to the adjacent owners but often have little to no value on their own.

One of the rooms has been turned into a grow room. Large garage front. Poor roof conditions. Part of the garage ceiling has fallen in. Wet inside. Mold is starting to grow on walls. This parcel has been posted as \"Condemned\" by the local building authority. Properties are generally condemned when they are deemed substandard, unsafe, or otherwise unfit for use and habitation. Condemned property must be rehabilitated to meet local building codes prior to use or occupancy. A building is not automatically slated for demolition when condemned. However, this does not necessarily mean that demolition will not also be pursued by the local unit. Please check with the local building official before bidding to determine the specific status and requirements for this property. This building contains evidence of mold. Mold is an indication of excess moisture which can come from a variety of sources including high ground water, improper sealing of foundation walls, damaged roofs, and other conditions which can be expensive to correct. Mold can pose significant health risks and, if extensive, may require a complete renovation which could exceed the value of the building.

Approx 0.12 acres Our review of this parcel indicates that the noted State Equalized Value (SEV) does not appear to reflect the current value of the property. This is often due to buildings or other improvements being demolished or fire damaged or other similar items included in the SEV being removed from the property. It can also be due to market changes in the area in which the property is located. It should be further noted that the SEV/assessed value of the parcel as noted in this listing may be several years old. You should consult a local real estate professional or appraiser to help you assess the current market value of this property before bidding and should not base your valuation on the stated SEV.

Unfortunately this home is suffering from mold that has become quite severe since its abandonment. Although the house is in poor shape the garage is in better shape.

Mold can pose significant health risks and, if extensive, may require a complete renovation which could exceed the value of the building. Please conduct your own research and bid accordingly.

There are substantial mold issues inside these buildings, so it is suggested that bidders bring a face mask or respirator with them. This lot consists of a bundle of 5 separate parcels in Marshall. The properties together were formerly an office/warehouse complex for State Farm Insurance.

This portion of the building appears to have remained dry and doesn't have any lingering odor suggesting otherwise. This space contains a vast grid of shelving units approximately 20 feet in height that apparently housed inventory at one point. There is a loading bay with several overhead doors that appear to be fully functional. The parking lot portions of this lot (53-001-963-00, 965-00, and 966-00) appear to be in relatively good shape. There were no glaring signs of frost heaving or large-scale breakup of the asphalt. There is some cracking as is typical of older pavement and some plant growth throughout. Overall, though, the parking lots are decent. All of the parking areas appear to be lighted. The functionality of the outdoor lighting was not verified but most if not all of the parking lighting appeared to be intact. The second building (53-002-270-00) was formerly used as an office and executive complex. This property includes a reception area, abundant office and cubicle space, training rooms, conference space, an equipped kitchen and cafeteria, and a loading bay. Most of the building infrastructure appears to be in place. The electrical system appears largely intact and has not been stripped. The lights were working during our inspection. The boilers and air handling system also appear to be in place and have not been removed. However, their functionality and condition could not be verified. This space has been vacant for a significant period of time and has seen significant water intrusion. Mold is prevalent, particularly in the eastern portion of the building where it is abundant. Damp carpeting and floors were observed in some portions of the building and there is a noticeable odor. The basement has also experienced significant water damage. Despite the water damage, the bones of this office building appear to be in relatively good shape. We didn't notice any significant decay to the building facade or foundation. However, the roof clearly needs repair to address the water issue and significant work would be required to rehab the interior. NOTE: If this lot is not sold on the September 30th auction, it will be offered at the Calhoun County no-minimum auction on October 31st. However, if sold at the no-reserve auction, the buyer will be required to furnish a $750,000 performance bond to the Calhoun county treasurer in order to assure that the north property identified as parcel number 53-002-270-00 is demolished or renovated/ redeveloped by 12/31/18. A complete demolition project will be signified by total site clearance and a final permit inspection and sign off by the City of Marshal. Likewise, a finalized renovation/redevelopment project will be demonstrated by obtaining a certificate of occupancy from the City of Marshall. This building contains evidence of mold. Mold is an indication of excess moisture which can come from a variety of sources including high ground water, improper sealing of foundation walls, damaged roofs, and other conditions which can be expensive to correct. Mold can pose significant health risks and, if extensive, may require a complete renovation which could exceed the value of the building. Please conduct your own research and bid accordingly.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/96428"},

{"title": "Downtown Storefront In Ontonagon", "comments": "This is one half of the building that formerly contained the \"Captains\" Restaurant and Lounge. We are offering ONLY THE LOUNGE half of the property ... even though they are connected on the interior ... This property has a weak floor back in the kitchen, and it looks as though roof issues may be starting on the one story flat roof. This property has been vacant for probably nearing a decade now, and the two halves have been through a parade of owners, some of whom only bought it to remove its contents and then let it go again. It may be a worthwhile project for someone to acquire the other half ... as well as the building to the right/east, and re-establish a business here. The building is still restorable, but will require some elbow grease and investment. This is a very visible location in Ontonagons Central Business District.

{"title": "Vacant Lot In Presque Isle Harbor", "comments": "ATTN: NO ONLINE OR ABSENTEE BIDDING FOR THIS BUNDLED PARCEL. Presque Isle Harbor is a resort and recreation paradise nestled in a bay located not far north of Alpena.In this area, dozens of subdivision plats were laid out in the last half of the 20th century. There are thousands of lots in these subdivisions. It was a very optimistic venture that anticpated hundreds of vacation and retirement homes. Growth here did not meet the expectations of the original developers, and while the lots sold briskly, construction of homes lagged at a relatively slow pace for much the last 30 years.Many of the roads in the subdivisions have few homes and a good number have none at all. Those closest to the water and amenities are understandably the most populated and improved, and buyers would be well advised to study the aerial maps available on this website to determine those areas in the development that have attracted the most construction.But for those seeking solitude, this development has plenty of that to offer as well. There are numerous pockets in these subdivisions, where you can quite literally have the entire neighborhood to yourself if that is to your liking. The area is served by county maintained roads, mostly paved, and a private water system that provide water utility to most every lot.There is a strong and ambitious property owners association (POA) here, which offers a clubhouse with pool, beach access, a campground and many other assets to members. We have linked to the POA website, where you can find much information relating to both the area and the associations benefits. The website is located at http://presqueisleharbor.org/association.shtml&lt;p&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;p&gt;We should note that these lots are not suited to \"flipping\" experiments. The association and water authority are quite serious about collecting their dues and quarterly water fees. Buying lots here is recommended for those who have an intention to keep and use them personally, and not for speculators. &lt;p&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PLEASE NOTE: In addition to the final bid price and summer taxes, a purchaser will be required to post a CASH BOND within 10 days of the sale in the amount of $20,000.00 for the purpose of assuring payment of the summer and winter property taxes for these parcels for the period 2016 to 2020. The purchaser shall be allowed to draw against this bond for purposes of making the annual property tax payments for all of the lots in this bundle with the permission of the seller during that time period. The bond shall require express authority of the seller to make any draws, payments or other debits against its balance. The cash bond shall be created to the satisfaction of the seller within the 10 days period following sale, or the sale will be cancelled, no deed issued, and no refund made of the purchase price or summer tax payment. &lt;/p&gt; If you held an interest in this parcel prior to foreclosure and wish to buy it back, you are required by law to pay at least the minimum bid which was placed on the property during the first round auction.

This auction lot will ONLY be available to auction bidders that have submitted such a written plan to the FGU prior to the time and date noted, and whose plan is ACCEPTED by the FGU, in its sole discretion, as being in the interest of the public in abatement of the nuisance(s).

The individual lots here are typically 25x135 feet in size. Lands are generally dry and buildable, and have primitive roads. We suggest checking the county GIS mapping system for location assistance at http://www.mackinaccounty.net/departments/gis/ and then \"fetch the online map viewer\" Note: GPS coordinate is not exact. It indicates the approximate location of the parcels in this bundle. For Reference Only. This lot is owned by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and is offered for sale as part of the Department\u2019s surplus lands disposition process. Surplus lands have been identified as being of little public recreational value for reasons such as small size, lack of legal access, lack of adjacency to other state lands suitable for recreation, or other similar deficiencies.

{"title": "Older, Well Used Home In Onaway", "comments": "Older 1.5 story home on a corner lot in Onaway. Aluminum sided, will need a good cleanout and overall repair. The the front door is weathered and should be replaced, and the siding will need a good power washing. Someone has begun a remodel here, and then stopped. A new window has been framed into the front. Needs a general resurfacing and decor enhancements ... as well as general mechanical system overhaul. The structure appears to be solid and straight, but very grubby. The interior of this property was not viewed during our inspection. Buildings which are dangerous, occupied, boarded, condemned, or otherwise difficult to enter are inspected from the exterior/curbside only. You are NOT authorized to enter these or any other buildings offered for sale. You should limit your inspection to that which can be made safely from the building's exterior. The previous owner of this parcel undertook a construction or rehabilitation project which has not been completed. We have attempted to describe the degree to which the project has been finished, but the building should be be considered incomplete nonetheless. The local building code enforcement official may be able to offer additional insight as to why the project was never completed. Older mobile home with a well constructed steel roofover. Has a detached 2 car garage that appears to be in solid overall condition and newer overhead doors. We see broken windows, the yard has overgrown, and there are other various signs that this property has not been occupied in a while. There is still personal property belonging to the last owner here, and you'll want to make an effort at contact to see if they lay claim to any of it.The property appears to be in reasonable condition for what it is, and it probably would not be a huge task to make it merchantable again. This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/93475"},

There is a trail that runs right through the middle of this lot where it meets the road, and a culvert has been installed. Because of the small size of the lot, we can't be sure without a survey, but it appears this parcel is just south of the culvert. This parcel is too small to be practically useful under most circumstances. Many times such parcels are the result of survey or property transfer errors which create small orphaned slivers of land. These parcels are frequently too small to allow construction or any other practical use. They often have no road frontage or legal means of access.

{"title": "Cruddy Old Mobile Near Posen", "comments": "This mobile is probably best repurposed as scrap metal. It has been vacant for several years and has not been maintained. It has a solid looking roofover, however the leanto front porch is visibly decayed and weak and should be removed. The value here, if they're still good, is in the well and septic. The lot is 150x280, level, open and dry. Would make a a nice spot for a new home or replacement mobile if zoning permits. This parcel appears to include an area where a mobile home was previously located. Such mobile home pads will frequently include well/water and septic/sewer connections as well as power hookups. However, local zoning regulations may prohibit placing a new mobile home on this site despite the fact that one was previously located here. Please check local zoning regulations carefully prior to bidding. We make no representations or warranties as to the suitability of this parcel for any purpose.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/93469"},

{"title": "Occupied Older Country House Near Posen", "comments": "This is an older home near Posen that was OCCUPIED when we were near there in May. It has been modernized with vinyl siding and a newer roof, both of which appear to need some repair. Some of the siding has either blown off ... or may not have been completed. Because it is occupied, we did not have the opportunity to view the home in detail. We suspect it is not more than 2 bedrooms. It's a fairly small structure. Parcel is 137x238 in size. This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property. This property is occupied. Please respect the privacy of current occupants and limit any inspection to what can be safely observed from the road. Some occupants may be upset or angry and may meet contact with aggression or violence. Please use discretion and caution when researching this or other occupied properties. Furthermore, although this property has been foreclosed for unpaid taxes, occupants have certain rights under Michigan law and must be formally evicted if unwilling to leave voluntarily. You may wish to consult a licensed attorney for more information. The previous owner of this parcel undertook a construction or rehabilitation project which has not been completed. We have attempted to describe the degree to which the project has been finished, but the building should be be considered incomplete nonetheless. The local building code enforcement official may be able to offer additional insight as to why the project was never completed. The interior of this property was not viewed during our inspection. Buildings which are dangerous, occupied, boarded, condemned, or otherwise difficult to enter are inspected from the exterior/curbside only. You are NOT authorized to enter these or any other buildings offered for sale. You should limit your inspection to that which can be made safely from the building's exterior.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/93364"},

{"title": "Vacant Lot In Presque Isle Harbor", "comments": "Presque Isle Harbor is a resort and recreation paradise nestled in a bay located not far north of Alpena. In this area, dozens of subdivision plats were laid out in the last half of the 20th century. There are thousands of lots in these subdivisions. It was a very optimistic venture that anticpated hundreds of vacation and retirement homes. Growth here did not meet the expectations of the original developers, and while the lots sold briskly, construction of homes lagged at a relatively slow pace for much the last 30 years. Many of the roads in the subdivisions have few homes and a good number have none at all. Those closest to the water and amenities are understandably the most populated and improved, and buyers would be well advised to study the aerial maps available on this website to determine those areas in the development that have attracted the most construction. But for those seeking solitude, this development has plenty of that to offer as well. There are numerous pockets in these subdivisions, where you can quite literally have the entire neighborhood to yourself if that is to your liking. The area is served by county maintained roads, mostly paved, and a private water system that provide water utility to most every lot. There is a strong and ambitious property owners association (POA) here, which offers a clubhouse with pool, beach access, a campground and many other assets to members. We have linked to the POA website, where you can find much information relating to both the area and the associations benefits. The website is located at http://presqueisleharbor.org/association.shtml We should note that these lots are not suited to \"flipping\" experiments. The association and water authority are quite serious about collecting their dues and quarterly water fees. Buying lots here is recommended for those who have an intention to keep and use them personally, and not for speculators. This parcel is likely subject to ASSOCIATION FEES which are assessed to cover maintenance and other costs associated with the development in which the parcel is located. Interested parties should verify the existence and extent of association fees and costs prior to bidding.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/93356"},

We have sold these parcels numerous times, only to have them re-revert when the purchasers learn of the outstanding balance due on the assessments.The outstanding assessment balance due on these lots is approximately $50,000 as a round number. Rather than sell these parcels AGAIN and have them become delinquent and be foreclosed in 2 years AGAIN, this time the parcels are being offered as a group, with the condition that a purchaser will be required to pay the assessment balances in total PRIOR TO CONVEYANCE, or the sale will be canceled and no deed issued.We encourage any interested party to contact Alpena Township, and have the total payoff calculated for parcels 018-045-000-420-00, 018-250-000-012-01, 012-02, and 037-00.

If anyone has ever told you to GET LOST, this would be the place they were talking about. This parcel is accessible by a road that is believed to be a seasonal or non-maintained public road. While we make no representations or warranties as to the precise nature of such road access, our research suggests that this road is either 1) Not regularly graded; and/or 2) Not snow plowed in winters; and/or 3) Appears subject to fallen trees or other events which have not been addressed by the county road commission. You should conduct your own research into this issue prior to bidding. Our visual inspection indicated that electrical service was not available on or near this parcel. The nearest electric service appeared to be a considerable distance (hundreds or perhaps thousands of feet) from the property. As such, electrifying this parcel could be costly. Please conduct your own research prior to bidding. Our review of this parcel indicates that the noted State Equalized Value (SEV) does not appear to reflect the current value of the property. This is often due to buildings or other improvements being demolished or fire damaged or other similar items included in the SEV being removed from the property. It can also be due to market changes in the area in which the property is located. It should be further noted that the SEV/assessed value of the parcel as noted in this listing may be several years old. You should consult a local real estate professional or appraiser to help you assess the current market value of this property before bidding and should not base your valuation on the stated SEV.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/90970"},

{"title": "Cute Rustic Cabin Near Hillman", "comments": "We are selling parcels 4413 (driveway/access) and 4414 (cabin) as one group. This cabin sits a couple hundred feet off the road, at the end of a shared driveway. We suspect that multiple properties likely have an easement to use this driveway parcel. This is an old timey cabin west of Hillman in an area of older mid century cottages. The roof exhibits some bows and weaves, and a tree has fallen across the front yard, taking out the power service. The soils here are soft sandy loam. When this cabin was built, they probably skipped putting in real footings and just poured a slab. Over time it has settled, unevenly, and the roof reflects what has happened to the walls. The front door does not open because of the settling. The fireplace has cracked and efforts have been made in numerous spots to \"foam\" cracks and seperations where the walls and other surfaces are diverging. Can it be repaired ? Maybe with much effort. But this one needs someone with lots of talent and patience ... or a lot of duct tape. The foundation of one or more buildings located on this parcel appears to be failing. Correcting foundation issues can be very expensive and issues are often more complex than they initially appear. You should research this issue thoroughly prior to bidding on this parcel.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/90968"},
{"title": "Wooded Lot With Stored Mobile Near Hillman", "comments": "There is an older mobile located on this lot, but it has never been \"fully installed\". We did not see evidence of a well or septic here, but there is an electric service. We do not have title to this mobile, and it is clearly to be considered personal property, which could be removed by a title holder if they chose to. There is a bit of a junk yard to the south, but that is not a part of this parcel. Mobile homes (and some modular homes) can be separately titled and considered personal property. In these instances, there may be third parties that have the legal right to remove that mobile home from the parcel whether or not it has been assessed as part of the property in the past. We make no representations or warranties as to whether such mobile or modular homes are included with the real property offered for sale. It is the buyer\u2019s responsibility to conduct their own research as to the state of title. As a preliminary step, it may be useful to determine if an Affidavit of Affixture of Manufactured Home has been executed and recorded as outlined in MCL 125.2330i. You may wish to consult a licensed attorney or title company to assist in this research.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/90967"},
{"title": "One Story Mid-Century Home With Attached Garage Near Hillman.", "comments": "This one has not been used much in some time, tho it has a SatTV dish (?!). Sits a hundred feet or so back off Parker Road at its dul-de-sac, and the driveway has overgrown and there is a fallen tree and pile of brush blocking easy entry. Home is vinyl sided and would appear to be mid-century construction. It is generally straight and solid, but its condition is difficult to fully assess, because it is FULL of cast-offs. Once emptied, this house may finish up pretty decently. The roof does not seem to be leaking overall, but we noticed some ceiling issues at the south end of the building that are likely the result of either a localize roof issue, or perhaps attic dwelling critters. There is an auto in the garage that we do not have title to and it is not a part of this sale. Overall, this home seems to hold good potential for the talented rehabber looking for a fixer upper that they can redo on a reasonable budget. This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address.

The sale includes FOUR parcels of land, and is roughly 240x100 more or less. The original portions of the building are slab-on-grade and solidly floored. The \"kitchen\" addition to the rear is over a cellar and the floor is frame and a little spongy. It is also low ceiling space. The septic system here is modern and substantial. It is a \"mound\" type, and we assume to be fairly recent. We would check with the district health department on its attributes. We believe this is city water. Natural gas is here.

They are an iconic symbol of NE Michigan history. This one has suffered a little from neglect, but its pretty tough to put a concrete wall down. There appears to have been some effort undertaken to repair the bottom portion of the wall around the east end of the house, as they trenched an area next to the house ... and then did nothing further. It may have been below grade. We can't be sure without first hand knowledge. The structure will need a new roof, and some repair to the front wall near the footing in one area, but this is a pretty maintenance-free exterior. The interior is mostly slab-on-grade. There is a woodburning fireplace. Overall it appears to be fairly solid, but is decor-challenged. We assume that the mechanicals in this one will need substantial upgrading. NOTE: Sale 4402 is right-next-door, in case you are looking for a vacation place for your in laws. There is a detached, 2 car garage that is in very good overall condition.

Portions of this parcel exhibit wetlands indicators, but there is an improved driveway through it. There is a campspot and camper further back on this road that are NOT a part of this parcel. The property line is approximately where the driveway is marked with a rope and survey tape. This parcel has surface water, soil, or vegetation conditions indicating that it may include wetland habitat. Such habitat may comprise all or part of the parcel's area.

There are many environmental and building regulations related to wetlands which you should consult before bidding on this parcel. It is your responsibility to determine if this parcel is suitable for your desired use. This parcel may be subject to utility, road, driveway right-of-way, or other easements which could allow third parties access to the property. Easements are not extinguished by tax foreclosure and foreclosed parcels are sold subject to these preexisting rights, if any.

{"title": "Cute Little Chalet Style Home With Shared Lake Huron Access!", "comments": "This sale contains a cute, modern Chalet style home on two lots. It is modern construction and has been well maintained from appearances. This is located in the Cordwood Point Property Owners Association and has shared access and a clubhouse on LAKE HURON about an hour east of the Mighty Mac. Membership POA fees apply here. Home has two bedrooms plus a second floor loft and appears to be in ready-to-use condition after some freeze damage is repaired. We discovered a crack in the turlet, so we assume there is some freeze damage to the water supply lines. It has been vacant since about August 2015, when the power was turned off. This will be a very popular parcel in this condition, so bring your checkbook and be prepared to bid !! Please note that this property was furnished with personal effects when we visited in May. Personal property is NOT INCLUDED in this sale and remains the property of the former owner or occcupant of this property. This property contains physical indications that one or more water lines have frozen, ruptured, and leaked for a significant period of time prior to being shut off. Such indications can include damage to ceilings and floors and visibly damaged pipes and fixtures. Damage from freeze bursts can be substantial including significant harm to structural components such as framing and foundations. This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property.

Gravel Quarry Potential.", "comments": "Parcels 1607, 1608, 1609 and 1610 are 4 adjoining acreage parcels that total 425+ acres. 1607 = 232.54 acres. 1608 = 120.87 acres. 1609 = 40.28 acres. 1610 = 32.25 acres. Access is off a gated, shared road off US 23 just across the street from Lake Huron. Parcel 1607 is the largest parcel, the farthest back off the road, and is predominately recreational/hunting land. It contains significant wetlands areas, and a small stream. We did not see any improvements here other than deer blinds. Parcel 1608 is the most developed parcel. The parcel has an excavated area that is rich in nice gravel and sand, which is a hot commodity along the lakeshore in this area. There is a modern cabin here with cedar and pine interior, a detached 2 car and a gutted mobile home. The cabin is quite nice, has electric baseboard heat, and would appear to be ready-to-use. Parcel 1609 is a \"square 40\" without improvements that appears to be generally dry, level and mostly open. Parcel 1610 is 32.25 acres, and is the parcel that entry is first made upon when passing through the gated entry drive. There is a modular-type unit here which appears to have been used in the past as an office, but has the pontential to be converted to a residential use. This parcel was originally a \"square 40\", but a parcel has been sold from the center to a third party, of roughly 8 acres, that contains a cell phone communications tower. The tower is NOT a part of the lands being sold. This parcel also contains a 30x60 pole barn west of the tower parcel. This is a terrific recreational or estate property in a *very* secluded and private setting. It appears that one or two other land owners further back, and the communications tower operator share access over the road through these parcels, and there are daisy-chained padlocks that permit reciprocal access.

This is often due to buildings or other improvements being demolished or fire damaged or other similar items included in the SEV being removed from the property. It can also be due to market changes in the area in which the property is located. It should be further noted that the SEV/assessed value of the parcel as noted in this listing may be several years old.

The cottage is very authentic Yooper, and matches the one next door which was probably built simultaneously. There have been upgrades here, including a newer electrical service, and someone started (but did not finish) repairs to the rear facade. The cottage seems solid overall, but all log structures are an ongoing process of maintenance. Inside, the second floor of the original part of the building has been braced with a timber truss that could probably be aesthetically improved upon with steel and made less conspicuous. There is a shallow well pit in the garage. and a small outbuilding here in addition to the garage. Rear kitchen area is over a recent block foundation improvement. The frontage here is bluff frontage and probably in excess of 20 feet to a stony shoreline.

{"title": "Gift Shop Or Trinket Building In Paradise!", "comments": "This is a small frame construction building in Paradise that has been used as a gift shop, and more recently a food concession. It is in the central shopping district of Paradise village, and very visible to passing traffic. Commercial uses are the norm here. The property here is narrow and shaped like a slice of the pie. 75' wide on the road, 15' feet wide at the rear, and over 200 feet deep. The building is small, perhaps 600 to 800 square feet, and according to a neighbor (who voiced clear intention to bid on it himself) has no bathroom, and that without one, it cannot be used. He claims that there is not sufficient property to put a septic system on, but that has not been verified with the health department, who usually accomodate requests if at all possible. Given that this has been recently licensed as a food service operation, some of this claim seems dubious. There is a well on the property, and the food operation used sinks in their food prep, so there is clearly *some* sort of existing waste disposal system in place here. Our experience is that some systems are now engineered with a single pipe field, and there may well be room for this type of disposal onsite with proper engineering. You will want to check with the district health department on this if you're interested in the property. The interior of this property was not viewed during our inspection. Buildings which are dangerous, occupied, boarded, condemned, or otherwise difficult to enter are inspected from the exterior/curbside only.

Frenchman Lake is a \"fishing\" type lake moreso than a \"swimming\" lake, and the shoreline areas here are reeds not sand.

Public lake access is located at the entrance to the lakes near M-123 as is a small family resort with swimming beach area. The very south side, where this parcel is located is part of the Wegwas Association and accessed through a private road and gate.This is a very nice seasonal resort area, and having the village nearby is great for basic needs and recreation.

Neither front on a public road, so we are offering them as a unit so that one owner can determine and/or negotiate their access. 1730 is a 660' x 660' square 10 acre parcel that lies 660' north of the \"right of way\" for W Mills (8 Mile) Road, which shows on maps as a public road in this area. 1731 is a 330' (north-south) x 660' (east-west) parcel that lies directly south of 1730 and is 330' north of the public road. 8 Mile Road coming into this area from the west has been intentionally blocked with felled brush and trees by some nemesis, and the same road is gated at the east side when you try to come in that way. We did not find any two-tracks into these parcels that suggest an easement has been utilized by former owners, so you'll want to do some investigation into legal access here. What we *can* tell you, is that the last owners acquired this by a tax deed foreclosure over 35 years ago, and it does not appear that they ever made any effort to access the property during that time, so adverse possession of a road does not appear to be a viable remedy .... however prescriptive easement probably is. You'll want to consult with a real estate attorney on this one if the title record contains no specific mention of an easement. Our visual inspection indicated that electrical service was not available on or near this parcel. The nearest electric service appeared to be a considerable distance (hundreds or perhaps thousands of feet) from the property. As such, electrifying this parcel could be costly. Please conduct your own research prior to bidding. This parcel does not front on a public or privately deeded improved road.

So we presume that could be done here as well. The structure on the lot, which seems to be on sale 1727 but could run across the lot line, is a \"goner\". It has collapsed and is simply beyond reasonable repair. The roads here are likely seasonal, or at the very least wayyyyy down the plow list.

There is what remains of a liquid waste transfer apparatus on-site. There are 2-3 steel tanks here, and one of them is marked \"Superior Sanitation Inc\", and alongsaide it is a derrick of some kind. There is also a manmade lagoon/pond that was used as a part of this processing. in other words, this appears to have been the emptying station for a septic tank cleaning company. The lands here are not swampy, but they're certainly \"moist\". We saw some furrows, that would indicate someone has tried to direct surface waters here at least seasonally if not more often. If you're interested in this parcel, we'd recommend checking into its prior use, to be sure of what you're buying. This would likely make excellent cropland for hay, which is a common commodity in this area.

There is a two track that veers off South Fair Road (look for directional sign), and following that trail, tjhis lot is on the right hand side just a couple hundred feet in. There are no utilities up this road, but they could probably be brought in at not a horrible expense. You're just 200 feet or so off Fair Road. Keep in mind that this is an unimproved (and non-county maintained) road that is best considered private. The roads which are shown on plat or tax maps for this parcel do not appear to exist or may be located in a different location than shown on such maps. While a legal right to build such roads may remain, this construction would likely be very expensive. However, in some instances these unimproved roads have been vacated or abandoned by action of the local government and no such right to construct the roads remains. Issues surrounding unimproved roads can be complicated and expensive to resolve. You should investigate the existence of any roads and the ability to access this parcel thoroughly before bidding.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/89601"},

It was the location of the Family Dollar and Sky McFlys Bar and restaurant, the bar is closed and gone, and Family Dollar has moved across the street. It is apparent that maintenance has been let go here, and both buildings show evidence of bad roofs. Inside, the buildings are structurally sound, with concrete slab-on-grade floors. There has been some demolition inside, and ceilings are down inside both units from roof leaks. The restaurant side of the building is roughly 35x80 and the Family Dollar side of the building is about 60x160 feet deep, including a couple of additions to the rear. The rear addition to the building has a good, useable basement space with exterior stairwell. The ceilings there are over 8 foot, and it was dry.

{"title": "Single Family Home In Kincheloe Location.", "comments": "This is a single family home, originally built for service members at the Kincheloe AFB by the Federal government. The base was closed and housing converted to civilian ownership a couple decades ago. This home is a tri-level design with an attached one car garage. This is a solid house with functional mechanicals aas best we can tell, but needs a complete resurfacing and new kitchen. It appears that a lender repo'd this one and then abandon it. It has been vacant since at least 2013 according to paperwork we found posted on the door. Roof isn't new, but doesn't leak. Sofffits and facia boards could use some work. Siding is vinyl and in reasonable shape. It is posted as \"winterized\", but the date was January ... so we cannot guarantee that some damage had not occured already if it was vacant and unheated prior to that time. There is evidence posted which indicates that a lender may be attempting to foreclose upon this parcel after such parcel was foreclosed for delinquent property taxes. A purchaser may encounter future contact from this lender. Tax foreclosure supersedes the rights of mortgage holders. If a mortgage holder does not foreclose upon their mortgage interest prior to tax foreclosure, their right to do so is generally lost. Typically such mortgage holders were provided all necessary notice of tax foreclosure but failed to act in a timely fashion to preserve their interest. In rare instances it may be necessary to cancel a sale if a deficiency in notice to such a lender is discovered.

It appears to have been built with barrier free access in mind. It is in generally good repair, but will need resurfacing, as the floor ccoverings have all been removed or are stained and soiled. The basement level is not connected to the upper floor by an interior stairway, but is accessed by an outside stairway. The garage is connected to the house by a breezeway, and the yard is deep and private, with the house setting back off the road over 100 feet.

{"title": "40 Acres Of Recreational Property Near Hulbert!", "comments": "This is a remote 40 acre parcel several hundred feet off the nearest public road. Topographical maps suggest that the west 1/2 of this property is marshlands. We could not find a two track that would get us back into this locale, but we did notice that the area in general has a healthy growth of maple trees ! If you're interest in this parcel, you'll want to do some homework to determine easement and access rights, or you'll need a helicopter ! Aerial photos infer that this property is fully wooded, but we did not have the opportunity to get back in to verify that because of unknown access rights. Our visual inspection indicated that electrical service was not available on or near this parcel. The nearest electric service appeared to be a considerable distance (hundreds or perhaps thousands of feet) from the property. As such, electrifying this parcel could be costly. Please conduct your own research prior to bidding. This parcel does not front on a public or privately deeded improved road. Often times there are easements in the recorded chain-of-title that provide legal access to such parcels but other times there are not. You should thoroughly research this parcel's access rights prior to bidding.

Campspot!", "comments": "This parcel measures 271 feet (east-to-west) by 185 feet (north-to-south) and fronts on the west side South White Pine Row, north off M-134. The road here is probably a private one, and not county maintained. It is more like a good quality two-track. The lands here are level and dry, and wooded in evergreens and soft woods. The signs we placed is in an area where someone has cleared a slight campspot opening and is only estimated. It could be situated a little to the south of that sign. There is power here, and dropping a service to the property would be a snap. There are 4-5 other cabins on the lane, but none appear to be year round in use except one right on M-134. This parcel is accessible by a road that is believed to be a seasonal or non-maintained public road. While we make no representations or warranties as to the precise nature of such road access, our research suggests that this road is either 1) Not regularly graded; and/or 2) Not snow plowed in winters; and/or 3) Appears subject to fallen trees or other events which have not been addressed by the county road commission.

{"title": "Waterfront! West Neebish Channel Of The St Marys River!", "comments": "This is a loooooong narrow parcel of land, roughly 66 feet (north-south) x 1500 feet or so (east-west). Approaches to this parcel by two track roads from the southwest (off 11 Mile Road) are really the only way to get to it, as the access from 10 Mile Road to the north, then Klier Road ends at a gate that protects state marshlamnd preserves from motor vehicle access. If you come in to the property off 11 Mile Road, continue until you have reached a point where you are confronted with a gate dead ahead, and another to the right at 90 degrees .... and the far west end of this parcel is now ahead of you about half way to the gate. But if it's the waterfront you want to see ... you'll either have to come in by boat, or walk in through almost half a mile of dense brush. Either way, use of the waterfront here will require an investment in roadwork ... or perhaps negotiating a shared drive easement with the neighbor to the south who has that gated drive to your right at the end of 11 Mile Road. Topo maps of this area do not list this as wetlands, but visually, at least at the west end of the parcel, that is the appearance. This parcel is probably about 2 acres in size. It will likely require a survey to nail that down, as the waterfrontage could have a meander line as a boundary. Shorter version ? \"Chefs surprise!\" It appears that this parcel actually has road access to the far west end, but not to the waterfront area. The photois are of the general waterfrontage character and taken from the shoreline on another property to the north.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/89588"},
{"title": "The Historic Ransonville Schoolhouse!", "comments": "We are offering the historic Ransonville Schoolhouse building on M-129. This is a charmer but it has some structural issues that will require attention. It is built of brick, but was constructed on unstable, soft soils that just are not dealing with the weight very well. The front right corner of the building has some very obvious cracks from the settling of the building, and the front wall has an area of deflection that is probably 6 inches or more. The brick also shows decay along the bottom 4 feet or so all the way around, likely from absorbing ground water and then freezing and flaking off. This building looks good \"from the neck up\". It's the foundation that has issues. Inside, you'd never know there were issues outside. Floors are level and the walls are straight. Obviously, someone has compensated for the exterior condition which is likely to have been a longstanding condition. It has a newer 200 amp electric service and other than being cosmetically challenged, has a lot of potential. We would have a structural engineer take a good hard look at this one and make some recommendations. Parcel is 221x241.75 in size and just over 1 acre. Has a small frame storage building to the rear ... sort of an undersized one car garage. We found 3 lock sets inside the front door ... so this one has been in the repo system for a while.

There is a trail that runs right through the middle of this lot where it meets the road, and a culvert has been installed. Because of the small size of the lot, we can't be sure without a survey, but it appears this parcel is just south of the culvert.

We have sold these parcels numerous times, only to have them re-revert when the purchasers learn of the outstanding balance due on the assessments.The outstanding assessment balance due on these lots is approximately $39,361.98. Rather than sell these parcels AGAIN and have them become delinquent and be foreclosed in 2 years AGAIN, this time the parcels are being offered as a group, with the condition that a purchaser will be required to pay the assessment balances in total PRIOR TO CONVEYANCE, or the sale will be canceled and no deed issued. We encourage any interested party to contact Alpena Township, and have the total payoff calculated for parcels 018-045-000-420-00, 018-250-000-012-01, 012-02, and 037-00. The assessment for these parcels is roughly $5500 per year, and the assessment has another 10 years to run. So the amount necessary to retire these assessments in full and purchase the property is approximately $50,000 in addition to the winning bid and summer tax amounts due for 2016. If you are unwilling to pay the assessments in full, you should not bid on these parcels.In addition, this sale (the \"bundle\") includes eight parcels in the Thunder Bay Village subdivision(s). We have sold these lots, and others like them, numerous times, and we keep getting them back like the proverbial bad penny. The reason is pretty simple. Most of these are swamplots, and will not support construction or a septic system. They're not good for much except mosquito farming and (not) paying property taxes.The successful bidder for these 15 properties will have to pay the summer taxes in addition to the bid price, and the Thunder Bay Village parcels will include a deed restriction that stipulates tha they cannot be reconveyed to any third parties without the approval of the seller within 10 years, or all of the lots will revert to the seller without refund.These 15 parcels are sold as one unit, with the conditions noted above as requirements of sale:1) The US 23 assessments must be paid in full prior to the issuance of the deed or the sale will be cancelled, and;2) The Thunder Bay Village lots cannot be reconveyed within 10 yeas without the written consent of the Alpena County Treasurer, or title to all 8 parcels will revert to the seller without compensation to the purchaser or assigns.

It appears that this land was part of the North Tar Lake ETA 128(a) project of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and was the location of groundwater contamination studies in 2007. If you're intersted in this parcel, you'll want to study the past use of this property carefully to determine whether there is any potential liability involved in acquiring it. The contaminated \"lake\" of chemicals, which is 4 acres in size, and up to 27 feet deep is not ON this parcel. It merely just the victim of its contamination nearby. On the bright side, there is municipal water service nearby, and you would not be reliant on groundwater as a source if you were to utilitize this parcel.

Or maybe to keep the pigeons out. Either way, we did not view the interior and she is closed up tight ... probably by local authorities. We assume this has been condemned by the city building offficial, and that reuse would require it be brought to current building code, which could be a formidable task. The structure is a \"Biltmore\", and has several additions to the rear and side, some of which are leaning and weaving suggesting foundation issues. To the rear is a one story \"mother in law\" unit that is actually in pretty decent overall condition, but could still use some cosmetic updating to the exterior. Inside it has knotty pine, and has an updated (90's-ish) bath and kitchen. Newer forced air natural gas heat. Roof is not new, but does not appear to be a leaker. This is a two-for-one deal, but you have to demolish both of them.

{"title": "Large, 24 Unit, Multi-Family Housing Unit At White Pine ", "comments": "Sales 5109 and 5110 are reminders of the mining boom days in White Pine. These buildings first served as housing for mine workers, their families, and those in supporting local business during the last half of last century. When the mine closed, they transitioned to rental housing for those who stayed behind ... and then gradually fell vacant and into disrepair. The buildings are substantial, having almost a military housing grade of infrastructure to them. The floor decking on the main level is reinforced concrete, and the mechanical systems are hefty and elaborate for their time in this place. Each housing unit is separately wired to its own individual panelboard, but each building only has one power service. Because the individual units are fed from the basement level (which is underwater) we can't be sure if it is individually sub-metered. Sale 5110 is the more \"original\" of the two buildings, and we suspect it has been vacant longer, perhaps well over a decade. Unlike 5109, the roof has not been leaking for an extended period time, but we trust that is a short term situation at best. We aren't sure of their exact age, but we do know these buildings predate 1978. There is a high probability that the buildings contain either/both lead based paint and asbestos wrap on steam pipes in the corridor ceilings and basement level. The basement here is nearly full ... at least 5 foot in depth ... with water (power offf = no sump pump). We also noticed mold creeping up the main floor walls here, and some \"harvesting\" has been taking place of scrap metal (radiators etc). It will require \"deep pockets\" to restore this building to a code-approvable multi-family residential use. Are there other options ? It could possibly be used for storage or warehousing at a much lower cost, but with a similarly low return. This building exhibited more decay to the exterior surfaces that 5109, but that may be simply because the other unit has some more recent effort made at cosmetics.

At a previous tax auction, the property adjacent to this, which contains its septic system, was sold to a third party, who then donated it to the church next door. A buyer will want to investigate obtaining an easement, either voluntarily or with the assistance of circuit court, for the continued use of the septic system. This is an older wood frame building, the \"Amasa House\", a tavern in the Central Business District of the village. The building is vinyl sided, and the soffits on the right side are in rough shape. It appears that the left half of the building is the original structure, and the right side was added later, with a shared stairway to the second floor. Upstairs, the original/left half was originally a boarding or rooming house based on the layout we see. Parts of the upper floor have been stripped for a renovation that never happened, and there is a lot of incomplete construction. Overall, the building is solid, but all torn up. We'd recommend focus on getting a solid new roof on it, or the rest is meaningless. The roof does not seem to leak at present, but it's not going to be long until it does based on ther condition of the soffits and fascia.

Buildings may also be boarded by fire or other officials when they present a safety hazard. We generally do not enter boarded structures and limit our observations to the building's exterior. Likewise, you should limit any inspection of this property to its exterior only. You are not permitted to remove any boarding to view building interiors under any circumstances. Public property records or polite inquiries to neighbors may reveal additional information about a property's history.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/91963"},

{"title": "Commercial Storage Building", "comments": "This was once the pump house to a local company and now is used for storage. Personal contents still remain. 10002 Summet Street in Erie MI, is DEQ Facility #00018625. It is not listed as contaminated by the DEQ currently, but there was a 1000 gallon underground storage tank that was removed in 1971. There are no listed releases of contaminants at this location, however we advise the purchaser to seek a Baseline Environmental Assessment (BEA) within 45 days of purchase to protect themselves from any potential liability for costs of contamination. This parcel may contain buried storage tanks from previous use as a gas station or similar enterprise. Our analysis is based solely on visual inspection of the property surface as further detailed in the lot description. The State of Michigan may require a new owner to remove any remaining tanks and remediate environmental concerns at their sole expense. Additional information may be available from the MDEQ Storage Tank Database. You should conduct careful and thorough research prior to bidding on this parcel. This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/90903"},
{"title": "3 Bi-Plex Units In Erie Township", "comments": "Great investment potential. A total of six upper/lower units consisting of 2 bedroom, 1 bath, each having there own heat and air units. 2 of the lower units have had extensive MOLD and will need to be addressed. The rest of the units look to be in fair condition. This building contains evidence of mold. Mold is an indication of excess moisture which can come from a variety of sources including high ground water, improper sealing of foundation walls, damaged roofs, and other conditions which can be expensive to correct. Mold can pose significant health risks and, if extensive, may require a complete renovation which could exceed the value of the building. Please conduct your own research and bid accordingly. The building on this property appears to have been used for multi-family occupancy in the past based upon indicators such as multiple mailboxes, entrances, numbering, layout, or other such factors. Modifications to the property may NOT have been legally made and may NOT conform to local zoning. Prospective bidders should verify with local officials that multi-family use is permitted under existing zoning. In many areas, once a multi-family use has been discontinued, it cannot be reinstated unless in conformance with local zoning and code.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/90902"},

Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property. This building contains evidence of mold. Mold is an indication of excess moisture which can come from a variety of sources including high ground water, improper sealing of foundation walls, damaged roofs, and other conditions which can be expensive to correct. Mold can pose significant health risks and, if extensive, may require a complete renovation which could exceed the value of the building. Please conduct your own research and bid accordingly. One or more buildings on this parcel has a roof which is either leaking to the interior or appears close to failure. Failing roofs often indicate substantial structural decay inside the building. You should investigate the integrity of this structure(s) prior to bidding. The previous owner of this parcel undertook a construction or rehabilitation project which has not been completed. We have attempted to describe the degree to which the project has been finished, but the building should be be considered incomplete nonetheless. The local building code enforcement official may be able to offer additional insight as to why the project was never completed. A visual inspection indicated that this parcel may contain asbestos in the form of insulation on piping, boilers, or other structural components. However, no formal testing was conducted and the presence of asbestos has not be confirmed. There are other insulation products that are similar in appearance.
