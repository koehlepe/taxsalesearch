{"title": "22' Vacant Lot.", "comments": "This parcel is located within a municipality which monitors property maintenance and condition. You may be assessed fees and fines if you fail to mow the grass or do not otherwise properly maintain the property after purchase. One advantage to these parcels is that they typically have infrastructure nearby (water, sewer, power). However, you should confirm the availability of such utilities as well as the connection costs prior to bidding. It is your responsibility to determine whether a parcel is suitable for your desired purpose. This parcel is too small to be practically useful under most circumstances. Many times such parcels are the result of survey or property transfer errors which create small orphaned slivers of land. These parcels are frequently too small to allow construction or any other practical use. They often have no road frontage or legal means of access. These parcels can often lead to adverse claims or encroachments by neighboring land owners which can be complicated legal issues to resolve. Please investigate this parcel thoroughly prior to bidding. Our review of this parcel indicates that the noted State Equalized Value (SEV) does not appear to reflect the current value of the property. This is often due to buildings or other improvements being demolished or fire damaged or other similar items included in the SEV being removed from the property. It can also be due to market changes in the area in which the property is located. It should be further noted that the SEV/assessed value of the parcel as noted in this listing may be several years old. You should consult a local real estate professional or appraiser to help you assess the current market value of this property before bidding and should not base your valuation on the stated SEV.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/18422"},

{"title": "Occupied Rural Home And Outbuilding.", "comments": "This property is occupied. Please respect the privacy of current occupants and limit any inspection to what can be safely observed from the road. Some occupants may be upset or angry and may meet contact with aggression or violence. Please use discretion and caution when researching this or other occupied properties. Furthermore, although this property has been foreclosed for unpaid taxes, occupants have certain rights under Michigan law and must be formally evicted if unwilling to leave voluntarily. You may wish to consult a licensed attorney for more information. This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/18622"},

Condemned property must be rehabilitated to meet local building codes prior to use or occupancy. A building is not automatically slated for demolition when condemned. However, this does not necessarily mean that demolition will not also be pursued by the local unit.

Our review of this parcel indicates that the noted State Equalized Value (SEV) does not appear to reflect the current value of the property. This is often due to buildings or other improvements being demolished or fire damaged or other similar items included in the SEV being removed from the property.

Please respect the privacy of current occupants and limit any inspection to what can be safely observed from the road. Some occupants may be upset or angry and may meet contact with aggression or violence. Please use discretion and caution when researching this or other occupied properties. Furthermore, although this property has been foreclosed for unpaid taxes, occupants have certain rights under Michigan law and must be formally evicted if unwilling to leave voluntarily. You may wish to consult a licensed attorney for more information. This parcel includes structures which have been damaged by fire. It is up to the auction purchaser to determine if this property can be restored to a safe condition and to comply with all relevant local regulations and building codes. Please research thoroughly prior to bidding. The interior of this property was not viewed during our inspection.

{"title": "Hot Commercial Corner On High Traffic Chicago Dr In Holland !", "comments": "These parcels are being grouped together and sold as one. Buildings roof is in bad shape and is not reparable One or more structures was boarded when we conducted our assessment of this parcel. Properties may be boarded for a variety of reasons. For example, properties are often boarded to prevent trespassers from harvesting copper plumbing, wiring, and other fixtures. Buildings may also be boarded by fire or other officials when they present a safety hazard. We generally do not enter boarded structures and limit our observations to the building's exterior. Likewise, you should limit any inspection of this property to its exterior only. You are not permitted to remove any boarding to view building interiors under any circumstances. Public property records or polite inquiries to neighbors may reveal additional information about a property's history. This parcel includes a structure which should be considered DANGEROUS. This building has suffered structural damage which creates substantial risk of harm from falling through damaged areas or collapse from above. It may also contain extensive debris which could fall or collapse, rusty nails, broken glass, and other hazards. You are not permitted to enter this or any other structure offered at tax sale. You should limit your inspection only to what can be safely observed from the building's exterior. Trespassers are subject to prosecution. One or more buildings on this parcel has a roof which is either leaking to the interior or appears close to failure. Failing roofs often indicate substantial structural decay inside the building.

{"title": "Backyard. No Road Access.", "comments": "This parcel does not front on a public or privately deeded improved road. Often times there are easements in the recorded chain-of-title that provide legal access to such parcels but other times there are not. You should thoroughly research this parcel's access rights prior to bidding. It can require expensive, complicated, and time consuming legal proceedings to secure legal access to landlocked parcels that do not have easements for ingress and egress. This property appears as if it may be a side-yard parcel. Frequently homes are located on one parcel and the associated back or side-yard is located on a separate adjacent parcel. These side-yards are sometimes foreclosed while the home is not. This can create unfortunate situations where fenced boundaries, septic tanks, out buildings, garages, and other improvements that were previously associated with the home next door are sold on their own. Such parcels may have value to the adjacent owners but often have little to no value on their own. You should investigate this parcel carefully and understand what you are purchasing before you bid.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/18611"},

Some condominium units delegate things like exterior maintenance and repair to the COA whereas the owner remains responsible for the unit's interior. However, there are many varieties of condominiums including residential and commercial interior space, condo subdivision lots, condo boat slips, condo campsites and others. Prospective bidders should carefully review and understand the master deed, COA rules and regulations, and investigate association fees prior to bidding.

If a mortgage holder does not foreclose upon their mortgage interest prior to tax foreclosure, their right to do so is generally lost. Typically such mortgage holders were provided all necessary notice of tax foreclosure but failed to act in a timely fashion to preserve their interest.

Some condominium units delegate things like exterior maintenance and repair to the COA whereas the owner remains responsible for the unit's interior. However, there are many varieties of condominiums including residential and commercial interior space, condo subdivision lots, condo boat slips, condo campsites and others. Prospective bidders should carefully review and understand the master deed, COA rules and regulations, and investigate association fees prior to bidding. This parcel is likely subject to ASSOCIATION FEES which are assessed to cover maintenance and other costs associated with the development in which the parcel is located. Interested parties should verify the existence and extent of association fees and costs prior to bidding.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/15747"},

You should research this issue thoroughly prior to bidding on this parcel. One or more buildings on this parcel has a roof which is either leaking to the interior or appears close to failure. Failing roofs often indicate substantial structural decay inside the building. You should investigate the integrity of this structure(s) prior to bidding. This parcel has substantial structural issues caused by poor design, insufficient maintenance, or both. Such buildings may be subject to condemnation orders which we were unable to locate during our inspection.

{"title": "Handyman Special In Scottville !", "comments": "There is evidence posted which indicates that a lender may be attempting to foreclose upon this parcel after such parcel was foreclosed for delinquent property taxes. A purchaser may encounter future contact from this lender. Tax foreclosure supersedes the rights of mortgage holders. If a mortgage holder does not foreclose upon their mortgage interest prior to tax foreclosure, their right to do so is generally lost. Typically such mortgage holders were provided all necessary notice of tax foreclosure but failed to act in a timely fashion to preserve their interest. In rare instances it may be necessary to cancel a sale if a deficiency in notice to such a lender is discovered.

{"title": "66 Foot Wide Lot ....", "comments": "This parcel is what we refer to as a 33'/66'. We frequently see foreclosed parcels that are either 33 or 66 feet wide. These parcels are often a result of existing or former road rights of way. A common road right of way is 66 feet wide. Half of that is 33 feet. There are two common scenarios that we see. Scenario 1: A land owner splits a tract of land and creates a common easement parcel for access. They might then quit paying taxes on the parcel with road frontage knowing that the easement would remain even after foreclosure. Such easements are generally either 33 or 66 feet wide. Scenario 2: Rural land generally runs to the center of any public road on which it fronts whereas subdivided land usually runs to the edge of the road right-of-way. Sometimes during surveys or other splits, half of the right-of-way (usually 33 feet) can become orphaned, effectively turning to no-man's-land. Potential bidders should be aware that 33 and 66 foot wide parcels are very likely to include easements. That means that there are people who have a right to use the property even though they do not own the land. It is unlawful to cut off access over a 33 or 66 foot parcel where an easement already exists. Even if an easement doesn't already exists, courts will frequently create such an easement to prevent a neighboring parcel from becoming landlocked. Potential bidders should consider that this parcel likely has little value and cannot be used to landlock a neighboring parcel when there is no other path for ingress and egress.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/17440"},

{"title": "Half Of A Mobile Home ... And Deer !", "comments": "This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property. Mobile homes (and some modular homes) can be separately titled and considered personal property. In these instances, there may be third parties that have the legal right to remove that mobile home from the parcel whether or not it has been assessed as part of the property in the past.

{"title": "66 X 161 Foot Parcel On Drummond Island", "comments": "This parcel is what we refer to as a 33'/66'. We frequently see foreclosed parcels that are either 33 or 66 feet wide. These parcels are often a result of existing or former road rights of way. A common road right of way is 66 feet wide. Half of that is 33 feet. There are two common scenarios that we see. Scenario 1: A land owner splits a tract of land and creates a common easement parcel for access. They might then quit paying taxes on the parcel with road frontage knowing that the easement would remain even after foreclosure. Such easements are generally either 33 or 66 feet wide. Scenario 2: Rural land generally runs to the center of any public road on which it fronts whereas subdivided land usually runs to the edge of the road right-of-way. Sometimes during surveys or other splits, half of the right-of-way (usually 33 feet) can become orphaned, effectively turning to no-man's-land. Potential bidders should be aware that 33 and 66 foot wide parcels are very likely to include easements. That means that there are people who have a right to use the property even though they do not own the land. It is unlawful to cut off access over a 33 or 66 foot parcel where an easement already exists. Even if an easement doesn't already exists, courts will frequently create such an easement to prevent a neighboring parcel from becoming landlocked. Potential bidders should consider that this parcel likely has little value and cannot be used to landlock a neighboring parcel when there is no other path for ingress and egress.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/18377"},
