You may wish to consult a licensed attorney or title company to assist in this research. This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property. This property is occupied. Please respect the privacy of current occupants and limit any inspection to what can be safely observed from the road. Some occupants may be upset or angry and may meet contact with aggression or violence. Please use discretion and caution when researching this or other occupied properties.

{"title": "Spring Lake Parcel With Use Issues", "comments": "Property uses which don't conform to current zoning regulations may be permissible if grandfathered in. However, once such a non-conforming use ceases, that grandfathered status is often lost. This can include the use of mobile homes, multi-family construction, and other property uses which are no longer allowed by local zoning regulations. You should confirm with local zoning officials that your intended use of this property is allowed prior to bidding. This parcel does not front on a public or privately deeded improved road. Often times there are easements in the recorded chain-of-title that provide legal access to such parcels but other times there are not. You should thoroughly research this parcel's access rights prior to bidding. It can require expensive, complicated, and time consuming legal proceedings to secure legal access to landlocked parcels that do not have easements for ingress and egress.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/12882"},

{"title": "Cottage In Leach Lake Area.", "comments": "The foreclosure of this property may be subject to legal challenge by the former owner or another party of interest. Therefore, this parcel may be withheld from the sale if a legal action is commenced prior to the auction. The status of any such legal action, to the extent known, will be disclosed if the property is auctioned as planned. Bidders are advised that the cost of defending legal title after the auction is wholly the responsibility of the purchaser. Please conduct your own research and investigate any potential legal issues prior to bidding. This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/6015"},
{"title": "Riverfront Parcel", "comments": "This parcel is too small to be practically useful under most circumstances. Many times such parcels are the result of survey or property transfer errors which create small orphaned slivers of land. These parcels are frequently too small to allow construction or any other practical use. They often have no road frontage or legal means of access. These parcels can often lead to adverse claims or encroachments by neighboring land owners which can be complicated legal issues to resolve. Please investigate this parcel thoroughly prior to bidding. This parcel has surface water, soil, or vegetation conditions indicating that it may include wetland habitat. Such habitat may comprise all or part of the parcel's area. However, it is possible that this parcel contains buildable areas as well.

{"title": "60 X 80 Parcel", "comments": "This parcel is too small to be practically useful under most circumstances. Many times such parcels are the result of survey or property transfer errors which create small orphaned slivers of land. These parcels are frequently too small to allow construction or any other practical use. They often have no road frontage or legal means of access. These parcels can often lead to adverse claims or encroachments by neighboring land owners which can be complicated legal issues to resolve. Please investigate this parcel thoroughly prior to bidding. The roads which are shown on plat or tax maps for this parcel do not appear to exist or may be located in a different location than shown on such maps. While a legal right to build such roads may remain, this construction would likely be very expensive. However, in some instances these unimproved roads have been vacated or abandoned by action of the local government and no such right to construct the roads remains. Issues surrounding unimproved roads can be complicated and expensive to resolve. You should investigate the existence of any roads and the ability to access this parcel thoroughly before bidding.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/7114"},

Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/9741"},

In these instances, there may be third parties that have the legal right to remove that mobile home from the parcel whether or not it has been assessed as part of the property in the past. We make no representations or warranties as to whether such mobile or modular homes are included with the real property offered for sale. It is the buyer\u2019s responsibility to conduct their own research as to the state of title. As a preliminary step, it may be useful to determine if an Affidavit of Affixture of Manufactured Home has been executed and recorded as outlined in MCL 125.2330i. You may wish to consult a licensed attorney or title company to assist in this research. Property uses which don't conform to current zoning regulations may be permissible if grandfathered in. However, once such a non-conforming use ceases, that grandfathered status is often lost. This can include the use of mobile homes, multi-family construction, and other property uses which are no longer allowed by local zoning regulations. You should confirm with local zoning officials that your intended use of this property is allowed prior to bidding.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/9461"},
