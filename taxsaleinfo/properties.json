Often times there are easements in the recorded chain-of-title that provide legal access to such parcels but other times there are not. You should thoroughly research this parcel's access rights prior to bidding. It can require expensive, complicated, and time consuming legal proceedings to secure legal access to landlocked parcels that do not have easements for ingress and egress.                                                  This parcel is located within a municipality which monitors property maintenance and condition. You may be assessed fees and fines if you fail to mow the grass or do not otherwise properly maintain the property after purchase. One advantage to these parcels is that they typically have infrastructure nearby (water, sewer, power). However, you should confirm the availability of such utilities as well as the connection costs prior to bidding. It is your responsibility to determine whether a parcel is suitable for your desired purpose.                                                  IRS Limited Redemption Right\r This property is subject to redemption by the Internal Revenue Service through October 27, 2020 due to a lien possessed by the IRS prior to foreclosure. Pursuant to federal law, the Internal Revenue Service is granted an additional 120 days to redeem tax foreclosed property on which they possessed a lien. Normally, this extended redemption right has expired by the time tax foreclosed property is offered for sale. However, due to COVID-19, normal foreclosure timelines have been altered in 2020. As such, the IRS retains a right to redeem this property until October 27, 2020. As a result, the sale of this parcel remains subject to cancellation with a full refund to the buyer if the IRS chooses to exercise its right of redemption. A deed issued following the sale of this property will thus contain the following reverter clause:\u201cThis conveyance is made subject to a right of redemption possessed by the Internal Revenue Service which must be exercised no later than October 27, 2020. In the event that the Internal Revenue Service exercises its right of redemption, title shall automatically revert to Grantor and Grantee shall be awarded a full refund.
