{"title": "Large Storage Building In Cadillac.", "comments": "One of the former light manufacturing buildings of the Mitchell Corporation, manufacturer of auto trim and interiors. Has an dual tractor trailer and a single box truck exterior loading dock. Two story office section and tens of thousands of square feet of open storage. This building has been stripped of much of its high amperage copper power wiring, but most of the panels, busways and conduit remain. The building is fully sprinklered for fire suppression, but there are heads removed in various locations indicating that it is in disrepair. It was heated with a large steam boiler, which remains but is in unknown condition. There are miles of steam lines and air compressor runs. The rear portion of the building is one story, and it appears it needs a new roof as there is pooled water in the largest warehouse room. It would require significant investment for this to become light manufacturing space again, and that may not pass muster with zoning. Its highest and best use is likely as cold storage or warehousing. We would suggest contact the local zoning officer to assure that your intended uses of the building are permissible.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a REQUIREMENT of the office of the FIRE MARSHALL in the City of Cadillac, that the fire suppression (sprinkler) system in this building MUST BE IN OPERABLE CONDITION for any items to be stored in this building whatsoever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purchaser of this building will be required to post a $150,000 PERFORMANCE BOND in favor of the Wexford County Treasurer to assure that the fire suppression system is brought to operable condition; that roof repair or replacement is completed; and that the building pass local code enforcement inspections of all necessary types within 6 months of the sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please contact the auction house or office of the County Treasurer for complete details on the performance bond to be furnished PRIOR to bidding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Parties not furnishing evidence of commitment of a bond at the time of sale will not be issued a receipt or granted any right to enter for inspection. Any bond not executed and furnished within 20 days of the sale will be cause for a cancellation of the sale. &lt;/p&gt; If you held an interest in this parcel prior to foreclosure and wish to buy it back, you are required by law to pay at least the minimum bid which was placed on the property during the first round auction.

{"title": "Significant Historic Location At Painesdale. 9  Acres", "comments": "If walls could talk, this one could tell you the story of Copper Mining at Painesdale. This 9+ acre parcel is the warehouse for the Champion #4 mine, which sits across the street (not a part of this sale). There are two large, limestone buildings here, with the larger of the two being fairly ornate in design for a warehouse. The footprint of the two is roughly 150x60 (front) and 180x50 (rear). The two are connected and have several large overhead crane systems remaining from the \"old days\". The front building is very solid and shows little deterioration. The rear building is generally solid but could use some work on stone in places. The rear building has an addition to the far end that could be removed to bring the whole back to a unified appearance. There are two other metal buildings on the parcel, one is in poor condition. Neither are historically significant. The parcel is 9+ acres, much of which is a large slag pit and has no real functional use. There is roughly 4 acres of useful road-grade lands here. The site has 3 phase electrical service, however much of the wiring has been \"harvested\" for its copper value. We sold this property several years ago, and at that time it was fairly clean and secured. The present condition is quite messy. There are several thousand tires here as well as remnants of the last use, which was a metal scrapyard. The property is also subject to a lien by DEQ for past expenses in cleaning up contamination at the property. A purchaser will \"inherit\" this lien, which is well in excess of $150,000 as a part of the transaction. If you have sincerely interest in the details of this property, please consult with the Houghton County Treasurers office.

{"title": "Restoration Project In Downtown Walkerville", "comments": "Prominent downtown Walkerville building. Has most recently been used as a tavern, but was likely originally a hotel property based upon the location of the stairway to the second floor. This one will take deep pockets to bring back to its true glory, but it is salvagable right now if someone gets to it quickly. Surprisingly, the roof (which does have leaks) appears to have generally been kept up over the years, and there is little serious structural rot with the exception of a few localized areas along the back 15 feet or so of the building. However it does need a new roof sooner rather than later presently. The largest issue here seems to be the exterior deterioration of the brick itself. The northeast corner, at the intersection, has visible signs of deflection that if not properly addressed could result in that corener of the building literally falling off. There are signs of delamination of the brick courses here, and there is extensive decay to the surface brick, especially over the rear wall of the building. There is a mansard type soffit over the upper floor of the rear ... god only knows what multitude of dins are hidden there. The main floor has been stripped of most of its historic character other than the stairwell to the second floor. That level was likely very small hotel rooms originally, but they have been stripped and joined together into larger suites. The second floor does not appear to have been fully used in decades. The entire building will need all new mechanicals. The plumbing is antiquated, and the wiring is hacked up and in unsafe condition and should be redone as well. The heating system is mid-century and likely junk. There is lots of debris here, and you'll be on a first name basis with the dumpster people. This could be a tremendous community asset in the right hands, but is not for the faint of heart or an undercapitalized dreamer. This is a serious project for a realistic investor.

Mold is an indication of excess moisture which can come from a variety of sources including high ground water, improper sealing of foundation walls, damaged roofs, and other conditions which can be expensive to correct. Mold can pose significant health risks and, if extensive, may require a complete renovation which could exceed the value of the building. Please conduct your own research and bid accordingly.

Street parking in front and large parking lot in rear. The upstairs is connected to the building next door through a doorway that has been left open. There is significant roof damage and flooding in the connected unit that doesn't appear to have affected this building. This parcel has been posted as \"Condemned\" by the local building authority. Properties are generally condemned when they are deemed substandard, unsafe, or otherwise unfit for use and habitation. Condemned property must be rehabilitated to meet local building codes prior to use or occupancy. A building is not automatically slated for demolition when condemned. However, this does not necessarily mean that demolition will not also be pursued by the local unit. Please check with the local building official before bidding to determine the specific status and requirements for this property. Large house, setup for use as 2 separate apartments. Across the street from Albion District Library. Between existing home and law office. Chimney and roof are in bad condition. Large amount of debris inside house.

You should confirm the status of this parcel as well as the allocation of the cost of demolition prior to bidding. The building on this property appears to have been used for multi-family occupancy in the past based upon indicators such as multiple mailboxes, entrances, numbering, layout, or other such factors. Modifications to the property may NOT have been legally made and may NOT conform to local zoning. Prospective bidders should verify with local officials that multi-family use is permitted under existing zoning. In many areas, once a multi-family use has been discontinued, it cannot be reinstated unless in conformance with local zoning and code. Lot is between two existing homes. The lot is sloped from the south to the north end. This parcel is located within a municipality which monitors property maintenance and condition. You may be assessed fees and fines if you fail to mow the grass or do not otherwise properly maintain the property after purchase.

{"title": "Upper Floor Residential Condo Unit In Suttons Bay", "comments": "This is the upper floor, south section of a 4 unit condo structure at Bay View near Suttons Bay. It has been rough plumbed and wired, and the HVAC is in, but no other fixtures have been installed. It has never been occupied. Unit will need surfacing, drywall, fixtures and decor. Condo fees are $1025 per quarter. The lower units here are commercial, and the building has fire suppression sprinklers. There was a freeze incident and some limited water damage in this building at some point in the past, but our visual observation did not indicate that there is any residual defect from that of substance. Unit has 3 bedrooms and 2 baths plus a laundry hookup planned. Utilities are separately metered. Nice views of Grand Traverse Bay. Paved outdoor communal parking. This lot is part of a condominium development. A condominium is a form of land ownership which is divided up into individual \"units.\" Owners are required to be part of the applicable condominium association (COA) which includes rules and regulations related to the use and ownership of each unit. Additional restrictions will be spelled out in the development's master deed. Condominiums also include association fees which can be significant. Some condominium units delegate things like exterior maintenance and repair to the COA whereas the owner remains responsible for the unit's interior. However, there are many varieties of condominiums including residential and commercial interior space, condo subdivision lots, condo boat slips, condo campsites and others. Prospective bidders should carefully review and understand the master deed, COA rules and regulations, and investigate association fees prior to bidding. The previous owner of this parcel undertook a construction or rehabilitation project which has not been completed. We have attempted to describe the degree to which the project has been finished, but the building should be be considered incomplete nonetheless.

{"title": "33' Wide Strip At Lincoln Lake.", "comments": "This is a 33' wide strip of land that runs north from ther intersection of Arrow Road and Lendale Street to Lincoln Lake. May have been an access parcel for offwater parcels or could have other restrictions as a road or easement that should be investigated prior to bidding. This parcel is what we refer to as a 33'/66'. We frequently see foreclosed parcels that are either 33 or 66 feet wide. These parcels are often a result of existing or former road rights of way. A common road right of way is 66 feet wide. Half of that is 33 feet. There are two common scenarios that we see. Scenario 1: A land owner splits a tract of land and creates a common easement parcel for access. They might then quit paying taxes on the parcel with road frontage knowing that the easement would remain even after foreclosure. Such easements are generally either 33 or 66 feet wide. Scenario 2: Rural land generally runs to the center of any public road on which it fronts whereas subdivided land usually runs to the edge of the road right-of-way. Sometimes during surveys or other splits, half of the right-of-way (usually 33 feet) can become orphaned, effectively turning to no-man's-land. Potential bidders should be aware that 33 and 66 foot wide parcels are very likely to include easements. That means that there are people who have a right to use the property even though they do not own the land. It is unlawful to cut off access over a 33 or 66 foot parcel where an easement already exists. Even if an easement doesn't already exists, courts will frequently create such an easement to prevent a neighboring parcel from becoming landlocked. Potential bidders should consider that this parcel likely has little value and cannot be used to landlock a neighboring parcel when there is no other path for ingress and egress. This parcel is too small to be practically useful under most circumstances. Many times such parcels are the result of survey or property transfer errors which create small orphaned slivers of land. These parcels are frequently too small to allow construction or any other practical use. They often have no road frontage or legal means of access. These parcels can often lead to adverse claims or encroachments by neighboring land owners which can be complicated legal issues to resolve.

This property was carefully and meticulously rehabbed in the 1980's at a cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Sadly, it feel into an idle condition and suffered water damage from burst pipes several winters ago. Since then, many of the fixtures have been removed, and drywall, insulation, flooring and doors were stripped to allow analysis and repair. There are 3 100A electric panels, gas forced air heat, and central air to part of the property. The 7 guest rooms had individual environmental units, most of which are gone or in disrepair. There was substantial freeze damage to the plumbing that has not been repaired. The electrical and plumbing systems will need a general rehab prior to new wallboard going back up. Subfloors will need replacement, and some of the underlying structure is also weak in spots. There was a managers quarters in the basement, and a 2 car garage and side courtyard that was used in the past for light food service. NOTE: This building has very little offstreet parking, which will affect its use for overnight accomodation or any significant traffic. It also does not meet barrier free code at present and is not fire suppressed as may be required for lodging use. The property was used sporadically in the past as an Inn or bed-and-breakfast, but to our knowledge was never a profitable venture ... more a labor of love. The Milwaukee House awaits a new proprietor with deep pockets to put her back into her glory. It would also make a wonderful corporate retreat or home. This property contains physical indications that one or more water lines have frozen, ruptured, and leaked for a significant period of time prior to being shut off. Such indications can include damage to ceilings and floors and visibly damaged pipes and fixtures.

{"title": "Restoration Project In Downtown Walkerville", "comments": "Prominent downtown Walkerville building. Has most recently been used as a tavern, but was likely originally a hotel property based upon the location of the stairway to the second floor. This one will take deep pockets to bring back to its true glory, but it is salvagable right now if someone gets to it quickly. Surprisingly, the roof (which does have leaks) appears to have generally been kept up over the years, and there is little serious structural rot with the exception of a few localized areas along the back 15 feet or so of the building. However it does need a new roof sooner rather than later presently. The largest issue here seems to be the exterior deterioration of the brick itself. The northeast corner, at the intersection, has visible signs of deflection that if not properly addressed could result in that corener of the building literally falling off. There are signs of delamination of the brick courses here, and there is extensive decay to the surface brick, especially over the rear wall of the building. There is a mansard type soffit over the upper floor of the rear ... god only knows what multitude of dins are hidden there. The main floor has been stripped of most of its historic character other than the stairwell to the second floor. That level was likely very small hotel rooms originally, but they have been stripped and joined together into larger suites. The second floor does not appear to have been fully used in decades. The entire building will need all new mechanicals. The plumbing is antiquated, and the wiring is hacked up and in unsafe condition and should be redone as well. The heating system is mid-century and likely junk. There is lots of debris here, and you'll be on a first name basis with the dumpster people. This could be a tremendous community asset in the right hands, but is not for the faint of heart or an undercapitalized dreamer. This is a serious project for a realistic investor.

Fire place on main floor. large living room. Paint peeling on exterior of home. After some hard work and repairs this could be a really cool house that could hold a large family comfortably. Retro cube windows. Nice sized sun room on second floor. Hardwood floors and tile throughout home. Repairs/renovations were being done but were not finished by the last residents. There is a third story attic that was being turned into an additional bedroom. Home is boarded on certain windows/entrances. Chain link fence surrounds entire property. Shared paved driveway that runs along side of home. Water heater has been removed and furnace looks to be in disrepair. One or more structures was boarded when we conducted our assessment of this parcel. Properties may be boarded for a variety of reasons. For example, properties are often boarded to prevent trespassers from harvesting copper plumbing, wiring, and other fixtures. Buildings may also be boarded by fire or other officials when they present a safety hazard. We generally do not enter boarded structures and limit our observations to the building's exterior. Likewise, you should limit any inspection of this property to its exterior only. You are not permitted to remove any boarding to view building interiors under any circumstances. Public property records or polite inquiries to neighbors may reveal additional information about a property's history. The previous owner of this parcel undertook a construction or rehabilitation project which has not been completed. We have attempted to describe the degree to which the project has been finished, but the building should be be considered incomplete nonetheless. The local building code enforcement official may be able to offer additional insight as to why the project was never completed. This parcel appears to have been subject to harvesting of electrical, plumbing, mechanical systems, or other building components. Buildings are sometimes targeted by criminals that steal or \"harvest\" items such as copper plumbing, wiring, furnaces, water heaters, fixtures, hardwood flooring, etc. This building should be considered incomplete due to such harvesting and may require substantial investment to reequip. The foundation of one or more buildings located on this parcel appears to be failing. Correcting foundation issues can be very expensive and issues are often more complex than they initially appear. You should research this issue thoroughly prior to bidding on this parcel.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/75688"},

Roof looks to be in fair condition but is wavy in certain areas. This property is occupied. Please respect the privacy of current occupants and limit any inspection to what can be safely observed from the road. Some occupants may be upset or angry and may meet contact with aggression or violence. Please use discretion and caution when researching this or other occupied properties. Furthermore, although this property has been foreclosed for unpaid taxes, occupants have certain rights under Michigan law and must be formally evicted if unwilling to leave voluntarily. You may wish to consult a licensed attorney for more information. This property appears as if it may be a side-yard parcel. Frequently homes are located on one parcel and the associated back or side-yard is located on a separate adjacent parcel. These side-yards are sometimes foreclosed while the home is not. This can create unfortunate situations where fenced boundaries, septic tanks, out buildings, garages, and other improvements that were previously associated with the home next door are sold on their own. Such parcels may have value to the adjacent owners but often have little to no value on their own.

{"title": "Large, Two Story Commercial Building (Former Restaurant) On N Clinton St. Near Downtown Albion. ", "comments": "This former restaurant and bar is located immediately across the tracks from the Albion passenger train station. The building has a large customer parking lot and an entrance on the side of the building facing the tracks. The main room of the restaurant is clean and still has all of the tables/chairs left by the previous owner. This room was also used as a music venue and has speakers wired throughout. The refrigeration equipment, including a large walk in and the bar coolers, are still installed. Many of the kitchen appliances are still in place. Customer bathrooms were functional. The second story located above the kitchen is unfinished but was used as a management office and a meeting space for employees. There is also a second bathroom on the upper floor. Most of the facility just needs to be cleaned and have debris removed. However, the roof is damaged above the office area and has been leaking down, through the floor, and into the kitchen below. There appears to be significant water damage in both areas. The basement was damp and had condensation on overhead pipes. One or more buildings on this parcel has a roof which is either leaking to the interior or appears close to failure. Failing roofs often indicate substantial structural decay inside the building. You should investigate the integrity of this structure(s) prior to bidding. This property is unsanitary and poses a potential health hazard because of raw food garbage, backed up sewer lines, or other similar waste. Such conditions can attract rodents, wild animals, and other vermin. You should bid accordingly and be prepared to mitigate the situation immediately upon purchase.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/75555"},

Old moldings, and sharp architectural details.Vandalized and striped, Old roof, could be brought back to life with a lot of work. Incomplete renovation work in back. Fenced back yard Pet and/or wild animal waste was observed within this property. Potential bidders should consider that urine stains/odors can be difficult to remove from porous surfaces such as wood floors or underlayment. A visual inspection indicated that this parcel may contain asbestos in the form of insulation on piping, boilers, or other structural components. However, no formal testing was conducted and the presence of asbestos has not be confirmed. There are other insulation products that are similar in appearance. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, asbestos is not likely to cause significant health risk when left undisturbed. See this EPA publication for additional information. It is the responsibility of the winning bidder to take proper safety precautions and conduct testing and/or removal efforts if deemed appropriate. This parcel appears to have been subject to harvesting of electrical, plumbing, mechanical systems, or other building components. Buildings are sometimes targeted by criminals that steal or \"harvest\" items such as copper plumbing, wiring, furnaces, water heaters, fixtures, hardwood flooring, etc. This building should be considered incomplete due to such harvesting and may require substantial investment to reequip. The previous owner of this parcel undertook a construction or rehabilitation project which has not been completed. We have attempted to describe the degree to which the project has been finished, but the building should be be considered incomplete nonetheless. The local building code enforcement official may be able to offer additional insight as to why the project was never completed. This building contains evidence of mold. Mold is an indication of excess moisture which can come from a variety of sources including high ground water, improper sealing of foundation walls, damaged roofs, and other conditions which can be expensive to correct. Mold can pose significant health risks and, if extensive, may require a complete renovation which could exceed the value of the building. Please conduct your own research and bid accordingly. This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property. One or more buildings on this parcel has a roof which is either leaking to the interior or appears close to failure. Failing roofs often indicate substantial structural decay inside the building. You should investigate the integrity of this structure(s) prior to bidding. This property is unsanitary and poses a potential health hazard because of raw food garbage, backed up sewer lines, or other similar waste. Such conditions can attract rodents, wild animals, and other vermin. You should bid accordingly and be prepared to mitigate the situation immediately upon purchase. This property has been subject to vandalism by former occupants or other parties. Typical damage includes broken windows, holes in walls, broken doors and doorjambs, and other damage which can add to the cost of repair and rehabilitation.

Modifications to the property may NOT have been legally made and may NOT conform to local zoning. Prospective bidders should verify with local officials that multi-family use is permitted under existing zoning. In many areas, once a multi-family use has been discontinued, it cannot be reinstated unless in conformance with local zoning and code. One or more buildings on this parcel has a roof which is either leaking to the interior or appears close to failure. Failing roofs often indicate substantial structural decay inside the building. You should investigate the integrity of this structure(s) prior to bidding. There is evidence posted which indicates that a lender may be attempting to foreclose upon this parcel after such parcel was foreclosed for delinquent property taxes. A purchaser may encounter future contact from this lender. Tax foreclosure supersedes the rights of mortgage holders. If a mortgage holder does not foreclose upon their mortgage interest prior to tax foreclosure, their right to do so is generally lost. Typically such mortgage holders were provided all necessary notice of tax foreclosure but failed to act in a timely fashion to preserve their interest. In rare instances it may be necessary to cancel a sale if a deficiency in notice to such a lender is discovered.

You should conduct your own research into this issue prior to bidding. This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value.

DISCLAIMER: This property was the location of alleged sexual crimes for which the offender is now in prison. This could affect the resale value of this property. Bid accordingly. Our review of this parcel indicates that the noted State Equalized Value (SEV) does not appear to reflect the current value of the property. This is often due to buildings or other improvements being demolished or fire damaged or other similar items included in the SEV being removed from the property. It can also be due to market changes in the area in which the property is located. It should be further noted that the SEV/assessed value of the parcel as noted in this listing may be several years old. You should consult a local real estate professional or appraiser to help you assess the current market value of this property before bidding and should not base your valuation on the stated SEV. This parcel includes structures which have been damaged by fire. It is up to the auction purchaser to determine if this property can be restored to a safe condition and to comply with all relevant local regulations and building codes.

Our review of this parcel indicates that the noted State Equalized Value (SEV) does not appear to reflect the current value of the property. This is often due to buildings or other improvements being demolished or fire damaged or other similar items included in the SEV being removed from the property.

The building is a Quonset hut-type metal building with a fenced side yard. Past uses here have included those types of things that could cause soil contamination, so we strong suggest that a purchaser obtain a Baseline Environmental Assessment (BEA) upon purchase, and may wish to consult with environmental professionals prior to bidding as well. The interior of the building is dirty, with lots of surface grime from oil and grease. There is a floor pit and several areas where it appears oils and solvents may have been introduced into drains and sinks. The rear yard, which is not paved, has 300 or so scrap tires and a large berm of soil that we're not sure the origin (or contents) of. There is an office area, as well as loft storage. The building has 200A 3-phase power service and municipal water and sewer. Natural gas here as well. We also noted a couple dozen 55 gallon steel drums of mixed labeling with unknown contents. The soils to the north side of the building are visibly affected with unknown substances that we presume are oil or solvent related. A visual inspection of this parcel indicates potential environmental contamination. Visual indicators can include things like used tires, dirty soils, or chemically intensive former uses such as dry cleaning. Prospective bidders should carefully research the condition of this property prior to bidding. You may with to contact the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality or other relevant state agencies for additional guidance. Purchasers are strongly advised to obtain a Baseline Environmental Assessment (BEA). Some basic information about BEA can be found here.

This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property. Mobile homes (and some modular homes) can be separately titled and considered personal property. In these instances, there may be third parties that have the legal right to remove that mobile home from the parcel whether or not it has been assessed as part of the property in the past. We make no representations or warranties as to whether such mobile or modular homes are included with the real property offered for sale. It is the buyer\u2019s responsibility to conduct their own research as to the state of title. As a preliminary step, it may be useful to determine if an Affidavit of Affixture of Manufactured Home has been executed and recorded as outlined in MCL 125.2330i.

The interior of this home is difficult to assess because of the amount of debris scattered everywhere, but it appears to be generally sound. No major roof leaks noted. A couple of 30 yard dumpsters and a work crew would clean this one out in a weekend. We would think that this one is worthy of rehabbing based on what we could see when it is full of garbage. If it has a basement or crawlspace, we did not see a way to access it. Might be full of gold. Or not. This property is unsanitary and poses a potential health hazard because of raw food garbage, backed up sewer lines, or other similar waste. Such conditions can attract rodents, wild animals, and other vermin. You should bid accordingly and be prepared to mitigate the situation immediately upon purchase.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/72541"},

The electric service has been upgraded to a more modern 100A panelboard. Steel roof that does not appear to leak. We did not locate a well, but we notice a water heater *and* large water jugs. There is a crude septic system that may not meet current code. Could be a really cute little place with the right finishing touches. The bones are good. The previous owner of this parcel undertook a construction or rehabilitation project which has not been completed. We have attempted to describe the degree to which the project has been finished, but the building should be be considered incomplete nonetheless.

It appears that the building had hot water heat, but the boiler is not to be found. The plumbing supply lines are mostly plastic, and mostly shattered from freeze damage. The electric service is in disarray and should be thoroughly checked before energizing. The home has one upper bedroom, plus a small loft. A small room on the main floor could be used as a second beroom of small office or den. The roof appears to be generally leak free. There is a gppd amount of debris to toss out. Please note that this parcel is directly across the street from sale # 403. Buy both and double the acreage ! 2 acres more or less. This property contains physical indications that one or more water lines have frozen, ruptured, and leaked for a significant period of time prior to being shut off.

{"title": "Former Cheboygan Co-Op Grain Elevator Building", "comments": "If you're looking for open, loft-type space, THIS IS IT. The former Cheboygan co-op grain elevator building is in generally solid condition. Most of the grain handling equipment remains, and the truck scale appears to be mostly intact as well. There are 2 floors with 10' ceilings that is solidly building in a traditional post and beam method. There is a substantial 3 phase electric service that is older but likely serviceable. The roof appears to have reasonably maintained, although there is a portion of the foundation along the north wall that is concerning. We could not view the basement because of standing water that exists because the power is off and the sump pumps are inoperable. (Welcome to Cheboygan). This building could make a fabulous flea market, artist cooperative or antique mall. Let your imagination loose on this one. It appears that the lot to the south is owned by the neighbor to the west.

Construction here is subject to the restrictions of the master deed, and the purchaser assumes liability for association fees effective April 1, 2015. This parcel is part of a site condominium development. A condominium \"unit\" is a form of land ownership which is similar to a traditional subdivision \"lot\" but is also different in some important respects. Each condominium development is laid out in a document called the master deed which outlines the extent and nature of each condominium unit. The master deed also contains rules and restrictions related to construction and permitted use. Construction requirements can include everything from the size or design of buildings to color and orientation on the site. Condominium developments also include \"common elements\" like streets and sidewalks which are shared across all units. Some developments include amenities like golf courses, clubhouses, beaches, pools, and parks whereas others include only basic infrastructure like roads and sidewalks. Site condominiums also include association fees which can be significant. Prospective bidders should carefully review and understand the master deed and investigate association fees prior to bidding.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/76418"},
