{"title": "Bundle", "comments": "The parcels in this sale unit are grouped, (\"bundled\") as permitted by MCL 211.78m. Many of these include structures which contain lead based paint. Some may contain asbestos. Many are in various stages of disrepair or collapse and are considered dangerous buildings and attractive nuisance. Some may be occupied by tenants-holding-over under law. These parcels are not being offered individually. They must be purchased as a single bundle at or above the minimum bid price, if any is stated. Pursuant to MCL 211.78 (1), the Foreclosing Governmental Unit (FGU) has determined that the most efficient and expeditious method to return many of these parcels to productive use, is to require their immediate demolition, remediation, rehabilitation or repurposing if sold at auction. Many of these parcels constitute blight, a public nuisance and abatement is considered necessary. Before their sale to ANY purchaser at auction, it is the intent of the FGU that any such purchaser shall demonstrate their financial ability and willingness to perform those actions necessary, in the public interest and welfare, to bring the properties into compliance with local codes and ordinances. Therefore, it is a further requirement of sale of the bundled properties that a purchaser must demolish, remediate, rehabilitate or repurpose these properties as follows: 1) ALL STRUCTURES must be secured and made un-enterable within 15 days of sale at auction, at the purchasers sole expense, or the sale shall be cancelled and no refund or deed issued. 2) Any visible refuse, garbage, trash or other cast off shall be removed from lands within 15 days of the sale at auction, at the purchasers sole expense, or the sale shall be cancelled and no refund or deed issued.. 3) The conditions required in (1) and (2) above shall be maintained against further entry or blight for a period of 12 months following the execution of a deed. 4) Those properties in the bundle that are beyond reasonable repair or economic vitality to repair must be demolished at the sole expense of the purchaser. The cost of such work shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. All such demolition must be performed within 6 months of deeding, by a licensed, insured demolition contractor acceptable to the code official of the local unit of government where the property is located. All proper permits for demolition and the removal and disposal of volatile debris (asbestos, contaminants etc) must be obtained. 5) Those properties in the bundle which appear to either the purchaser, FGU or the code enforcement official of the local unit of government to be potentially contaminated, shall be the subject of a Baseline Environmental Assessment (BEA) at the sole expense of the purchaser. The cost of such BEA(s) shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. The BEA(s) shall be conducted by an insured environmental consultant licensed in the State of Michigan within 45 days of purchase, and shall be fully complete and filed with the proper authorities within 90 days of purchase. The level of the BEA to be conducted shall be determined by the findings of the initial phase(s) of the BEA at each parcel subject to such study. Where contamination is evident, the purchaser shall indemnify the FGU with a separate performance bond (issued on the same terms as others herein required) in an amount equal to the full cost of remediation of the contamination at each such site, and for a period of twenty (20) years, unless remediation is undertaken and completed during that time period. If the site is remediated to a level satisfactory to state officials charged with such determinations, the requirement for a performance bond shall be removed for that site. 6) Those properties in the bundle which can be rehabilitated or repurposed shall be brought into compliance with all construction, occupancy, zoning and other use codes of the local unit of government within 12 months. Construction and/or mechanical permits must be obtained prior to performing such work. Occupancy permits must be obtained by the expiration of that term. All construction and rehabilitation work at these properties shall be carried out by contractors that are licensed and insured, and acceptable to the code enforcement officer of the local unit of government. The cost of such work shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. In pursuance of those requirements and their costs and timelines, the FGU is requiring the posting of a performance bond in the amount of $1,500,000.00. The performance bond shall be made out in favor of the Office of the Jackson County Treasurer (acting as the Foreclosing Governmental Unit). Evidence of the issuance and full payment for such bond shall be presented to the FGU within fifteen (15) days of the acceptance of the purchasers bid at auction. In the event evidence of issuance and full payment is not tendered within fifteen (15) days of sale, the sale shall be cancelled outright, and the purchaser considered non-responsive to a necessary condition of the sale. No receipt for the sale shall be issued, and the bidder shall not be entitled to enter upon such premises, until such bond is issued and deemed sufficient by the FGU. Such bond shall be issued by an underwriter licensed to do business in the State of Michigan, who is not the subject of any pending disciplinary action by the State of Michigan or any department, bureau or commission thereof. It shall be payable, in full amount, to the FGU in the event of either whole or partial non-performance of the terms above written for its entire duration. It shall run as effective and be fully pre-paid, for the entire term of twenty-four (24) months. Any overage or refund shall be payable to the purchaser upon earlier termination of the bond because of full performance hereunder. This 24 month time period is not applicable to those performance bonds required for contaminated parcels noted in (5) above. The original of such bond(s) shall be held by an escrow agent satisfactory to the FGU, fully prepaid, at the expense of the purchaser. In the event any purchaser is a corporate or other entity, the principals of such entity must also execute full-recourse personal guarantees that assure payment of the amount(s) due under performance bonds in the event they are not honored for any reason.

There is some black mold in the house caused from localized leaks in the roof. Gravel driveway leads to a 1 car detached garage that is in fair condition. There is a long wheelchair ramp leading to the front porch. This property is unsanitary and poses a potential health hazard because of raw food garbage, backed up sewer lines, or other similar waste. Such conditions can attract rodents, wild animals, and other vermin. You should bid accordingly and be prepared to mitigate the situation immediately upon purchase. This building contains evidence of mold. Mold is an indication of excess moisture which can come from a variety of sources including high ground water, improper sealing of foundation walls, damaged roofs, and other conditions which can be expensive to correct. Mold can pose significant health risks and, if extensive, may require a complete renovation which could exceed the value of the building. Please conduct your own research and bid accordingly. This vacant lot is approximately 0.28 acres of land. Grassy lot with a lot of vegetation in the back portion. Paved driveway access from the road. There are a few large trees on the property that provide ample shade. Nice spot to build. This parcel is located within a municipality which monitors property maintenance and condition. You may be assessed fees and fines if you fail to mow the grass or do not otherwise properly maintain the property after purchase. One advantage to these parcels is that they typically have infrastructure nearby (water, sewer, power). However, you should confirm the availability of such utilities as well as the connection costs prior to bidding. It is your responsibility to determine whether a parcel is suitable for your desired purpose. This vacant lot is approximately 0.19 acres. It is located next to a church.

{"title": "Occupied Modern Frame Construction Home Near Newberry", "comments": "Vinyl sided home with two detached garages (a one door and a two door) on a 1.48 acre parcel just north of Newberry. The home appears to be OCCUPIED at the time of our visit in late June, and there was a good amount of clutter and personal property here to be removed if it is left after being vacated. It is difficult to tell without an opportunity to see the inside whether this is a remodel or late century construction, but it appears to be decent workmanship and has been maintained pretty well until recently. Parcel has 264' feet along the east side of M-123m, and runs 244 feet deep. This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property. This property is occupied. Please respect the privacy of current occupants and limit any inspection to what can be safely observed from the road. Some occupants may be upset or angry and may meet contact with aggression or violence. Please use discretion and caution when researching this or other occupied properties.

A condominium \"unit\" is a form of land ownership which is similar to a traditional subdivision \"lot\" but is also different in some important respects. Each condominium development is laid out in a document called the master deed which outlines the extent and nature of each condominium unit. The master deed also contains rules and restrictions related to construction and permitted use. Construction requirements can include everything from the size or design of buildings to color and orientation on the site. Condominium developments also include \"common elements\" like streets and sidewalks which are shared across all units. Some developments include amenities like golf courses, clubhouses, beaches, pools, and parks whereas others include only basic infrastructure like roads and sidewalks.

Buildings which are dangerous, occupied, boarded, condemned, or otherwise difficult to enter are inspected from the exterior/curbside only. You are NOT authorized to enter these or any other buildings offered for sale. You should limit your inspection to that which can be made safely from the building's exterior. This parcel has been posted as \"Condemned\" by the local building authority. Properties are generally condemned when they are deemed substandard, unsafe, or otherwise unfit for use and habitation.

Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address.

Some condominium units delegate things like exterior maintenance and repair to the COA whereas the owner remains responsible for the unit's interior.

Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it.

We think on or both of the right side/center and east buildings may have been a movie theatre at one time based on what appears to be a sloped floor under the one there now. The front portion of the roof here was upgraded with a rubber EPDM roof at one time, but the rear portion has blown away and the inside has been saturated with water for at least 10 years now.

{"title": "Parcel And Mobile That Has Legal Access Issues.", "comments": "Parcel is 120' wide x 330' feet deep. It has NO legal access to road frontage at this time. There IS a legal easement to the property that shares the driveway with the property to the northeast (presently for sale) HOWEVER where that easement runs west to this parcel from the driveway is covered by the south 15 feet of the home on that parcel. In other words, the easement to this parcel has the neighbors house sitting on top of it. The rest of the neighbors here do NOT want you driving across their property to get to this one. Sooooooooooooo there isn't any way to get to this. If you could, there is an older mobile here that (so far) has a good roof and is merchantable. The well is bad we are told, and there is no septic system here ... or if there is, it's no good. Detached garage and storage shed as well as a camper to which we have no title. You will need to negotiate or litigate for access to this. There is a good amount of bad blood over this easement issue in this area, and that may not be a certain outcome. If you held an interest in this parcel prior to foreclosure and wish to buy it back, you are required by law to pay at least the minimum bid which was placed on the property during the first round auction.

The roads which are shown on plat or tax maps for this parcel do not appear to exist or may be located in a different location than shown on such maps. While a legal right to build such roads may remain, this construction would likely be very expensive. However, in some instances these unimproved roads have been vacated or abandoned by action of the local government and no such right to construct the roads remains. Issues surrounding unimproved roads can be complicated and expensive to resolve.

{"title": "40 Acres Near Atlanta!", "comments": "Offroad 40 acre parcel north of Atlanta. It's located about a mile away from power as best we can tell on the ground (unless it is closer on the backside somewhere). This parcel does not have public road frontage, and is located about 300 feet east of Decheau Lake Road. Access to a rustic cabin (in poor condition) is via a well site access road off M-33 North, south of Rouse Road. The structure is on the East side of the parcel, midway between the north and south line. The building is in serious disrepair and has large critter size inhabitants (probably raccoons) in the attic. The drive is near an ORV trail. Building is on pier footings and has no power or water. Very difficult to locate. An earlier deed in the title chain to this parcel reserved the mineral rights. We're not sure if they are still held by a third party, or if they've reverted to the surface owner, but because of the active natural gas production activity around here, its unlikely that they have reverted under the Michigan Marketable Title Act. USGS topographical surveys indicate that this is level, wooded, DRY land. If you're chasing this one, you'll want to verify the mineral rights (if that is important to you) as well as deeded easement rights to the property, if any exist. If you held an interest in this parcel prior to foreclosure and wish to buy it back, you are required by law to pay at least the minimum bid which was placed on the property during the first round auction. You are not eligible to purchase this property for the lower \"no reserve\" amount offered at this second round sale. The minimum bid includes all delinquent taxes, interest, penalties, and fees that were due on the property at the time of foreclosure. See MCL 211.78m(5) for more information. Our visual inspection indicated that electrical service was not available on or near this parcel. The nearest electric service appeared to be a considerable distance (hundreds or perhaps thousands of feet) from the property. As such, electrifying this parcel could be costly. Please conduct your own research prior to bidding. This parcel does not front on a public or privately deeded improved road. Often times there are easements in the recorded chain-of-title that provide legal access to such parcels but other times there are not. You should thoroughly research this parcel's access rights prior to bidding. It can require expensive, complicated, and time consuming legal proceedings to secure legal access to landlocked parcels that do not have easements for ingress and egress. In some cases, a party other than the surface land owner may own the right to explore for and remove oil, natural gas, and other minerals from a property. Such \"severed\" mineral rights generally include the right to enter upon the surface of the land in order to prospect or remove minerals located beneath the surface. If you are purchasing property of any substantial size (over a few acres), you may wish to investigate whether the mineral rights are included in the sale or if they have been severed and are owned by third parties. Significant mineral interests are held by the State of Michigan. Information about mineral interests held by the State can be found here. Even if not owned by the State, mineral rights may have been sold to third parties or retained by a previous owner. Oil, gas, and other severed mineral interests are not affected by property tax foreclosure. Furthermore, due to the complicated nature of mineral abstracting, such severed interests have not been examined during the foreclosure process. Severed mineral interest are not included as part of this sale. If the mineral interests have not been severed, such interests are included. However, it is the sole responsibility of a prospective purchaser to determine the state of any mineral interests associated with this property prior to bidding. Seller makes no representations or warranties regarding the state of title to any mineral interests associated with this parcel.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/110512"},

This parcel is too small to be practically useful under most circumstances. Many times such parcels are the result of survey or property transfer errors which create small orphaned slivers of land. These parcels are frequently too small to allow construction or any other practical use. They often have no road frontage or legal means of access. These parcels can often lead to adverse claims or encroachments by neighboring land owners which can be complicated legal issues to resolve. Please investigate this parcel thoroughly prior to bidding. This parcel is what we refer to as a 33'/66'. We frequently see foreclosed parcels that are either 33 or 66 feet wide. These parcels are often a result of existing or former road rights of way. A common road right of way is 66 feet wide. Half of that is 33 feet. There are two common scenarios that we see. Scenario 1: A land owner splits a tract of land and creates a common easement parcel for access. They might then quit paying taxes on the parcel with road frontage knowing that the easement would remain even after foreclosure. Such easements are generally either 33 or 66 feet wide. Scenario 2: Rural land generally runs to the center of any public road on which it fronts whereas subdivided land usually runs to the edge of the road right-of-way. Sometimes during surveys or other splits, half of the right-of-way (usually 33 feet) can become orphaned, effectively turning to no-man's-land. Potential bidders should be aware that 33 and 66 foot wide parcels are very likely to include easements. That means that there are people who have a right to use the property even though they do not own the land. It is unlawful to cut off access over a 33 or 66 foot parcel where an easement already exists. Even if an easement doesn't already exists, courts will frequently create such an easement to prevent a neighboring parcel from becoming landlocked. Potential bidders should consider that this parcel likely has little value and cannot be used to landlock a neighboring parcel when there is no other path for ingress and egress.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/109814"},

{"title": "Negaunee Duplex - Income Property Opportunity!", "comments": "Large, solid older duplex in Negaunee. While many multi-family units we see are converted single family homes, this one was built as a duplex, with the two units being symmetrical layouts. Each unit is 3 bedrooms and one bath. As far as we can tell the property is heated with a single boiler, which appears to be well past replacement age and condition. The two immediate needs here are a new roof and HVAC upgrade. The roof is deteriorated, but really only substantially affects the two bathrooms that are in the center-rear of the second floor. The chimney has also tipped over and scattered itself all over the roof below. Inside, the units are solid and have almost all of their original fabric (trim, hardwood floors, stained glass windows) intact. Kitchens and baths are old and could stand upgrading. There will be plaster repair necessary along the back wall, moreso in the left (130) side, The power meters have been removed, and we suspect that this property has been vacant for some time In the photo file, the tour begins on the main floor of the left (130) unit, goes to the second level, then attic, where we enter the right (128) unit and proceed from third to first floor.The synopsis here is that this is a solid, well built duplex that needs a roof, cosmetic upgrade and some attention to the HVAC system.

Our review of this parcel indicates that the noted State Equalized Value (SEV) does not appear to reflect the current value of the property. This is often due to buildings or other improvements being demolished or fire damaged or other similar items included in the SEV being removed from the property. It can also be due to market changes in the area in which the property is located. It should be further noted that the SEV/assessed value of the parcel as noted in this listing may be several years old.

Potential bidders should consider that this parcel likely has little value and cannot be used to landlock a neighboring parcel when there is no other path for ingress and egress.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/110488"},
{"title": "Log Biltmore-Mobile. 1+ Acre Near Newberry.", "comments": "This is a creative addition to a mobile. It appears that an older mobile was paired up with an old frame house, and then they added a couple more lean-to additions onto that, including a rustic vertical log front porch ... now collapsed. The workmanship here is primitive and its probably not worth restoring. So the value is in the 1.1 acre parcel, which is nice, dry, level open land. This is just a couple miles south of M-28 and not all too far from Newberry shopping and services. 208' on Airport Road (CR 399) and 238' deep to the east.

{"title": "Bundle", "comments": "NOTE: No online bidding accepted for this bundle. The parcels in this sale unit are grouped, (\"bundled\") as permitted by MCL 211.78m. Many of these include structures which contain lead based paint. Some may contain asbestos. Many are in various stages of disrepair or collapse and are considered dangerous buildings and attractive nuisance. Some may be occupied by tenants-holding-over under law. These parcels are not being offered individually. They must be purchased as a single bundle at or above the minimum bid price, if any is stated. Pursuant to MCL 211.78 (1), the Foreclosing Governmental Unit (FGU) has determined that the most efficient and expeditious method to return many of these parcels to productive use, is to require their immediate demolition, remediation, rehabilitation or repurposing if sold at auction. Many of these parcels constitute blight, a public nuisance and abatement is considered necessary. Before their sale to ANY purchaser at auction, it is the intent of the FGU that any such purchaser shall demonstrate their financial ability and willingness to perform those actions necessary, in the public interest and welfare, to bring the properties into compliance with local codes and ordinances. Therefore, it is a further requirement of sale of the bundled properties that a purchaser must demolish, remediate, rehabilitate or repurpose these properties as follows: 1) ALL STRUCTURES must be secured and made un-enterable within 15 days of sale at auction, at the purchasers sole expense, or the sale shall be cancelled and no refund or deed issued. 2) Any visible refuse, garbage, trash or other cast off shall be removed from lands within 15 days of the sale at auction, at the purchasers sole expense, or the sale shall be cancelled and no refund or deed issued.. 3) The conditions required in (1) and (2) above shall be maintained against further entry or blight for a period of 12 months following the execution of a deed. 4) Those properties in the bundle that are beyond reasonable repair or economic vitality to repair must be demolished at the sole expense of the purchaser. The cost of such work shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. All such demolition must be performed within 6 months of deeding, by a licensed, insured demolition contractor acceptable to the code official of the local unit of government where the property is located. All proper permits for demolition and the removal and disposal of volatile debris (asbestos, contaminants etc) must be obtained. 5) Those properties in the bundle which appear to either the purchaser, FGU or the code enforcement official of the local unit of government to be potentially contaminated, shall be the subject of a Baseline Environmental Assessment (BEA) at the sole expense of the purchaser. The cost of such BEA(s) shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. The BEA(s) shall be conducted by an insured environmental consultant licensed in the State of Michigan within 45 days of purchase, and shall be fully complete and filed with the proper authorities within 90 days of purchase. The level of the BEA to be conducted shall be determined by the findings of the initial phase(s) of the BEA at each parcel subject to such study. Where contamination is evident, the purchaser shall indemnify the FGU with a separate performance bond (issued on the same terms as others herein required) in an amount equal to the full cost of remediation of the contamination at each such site, and for a period of twenty (20) years, unless remediation is undertaken and completed during that time period. If the site is remediated to a level satisfactory to state officials charged with such determinations, the requirement for a performance bond shall be removed for that site. 6) Those properties in the bundle which can be rehabilitated or repurposed shall be brought into compliance with all construction, occupancy, zoning and other use codes of the local unit of government within 12 months. Construction and/or mechanical permits must be obtained prior to performing such work. Occupancy permits must be obtained by the expiration of that term. All construction and rehabilitation work at these properties shall be carried out by contractors that are licensed and insured, and acceptable to the code enforcement officer of the local unit of government. The cost of such work shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. In pursuance of those requirements and their costs and timelines, the FGU is requiring the posting of a performance bond in the amount of $1,000,000.00. The performance bond shall be made out in favor of the Office of the Kalamazoo County Treasurer (acting as the Foreclosing Governmental Unit). Evidence of the issuance and full payment for such bond shall be presented to the FGU within fifteen (15) days of the acceptance of the purchasers bid at auction. In the event evidence of issuance and full payment is not tendered within fifteen (15) days of sale, the sale shall be cancelled outright, and the purchaser considered non-responsive to a necessary condition of the sale. No receipt for the sale shall be issued, and the bidder shall not be entitled to enter upon such premises, until such bond is issued and deemed sufficient by the FGU. Such bond shall be issued by an underwriter licensed to do business in the State of Michigan, who is not the subject of any pending disciplinary action by the State of Michigan or any department, bureau or commission thereof. It shall be payable, in full amount, to the FGU in the event of either whole or partial non-performance of the terms above written for its entire duration. It shall run as effective and be fully pre-paid, for the entire term of twenty-four (24) months. Any overage or refund shall be payable to the purchaser upon earlier termination of the bond because of full performance hereunder. This 24 month time period is not applicable to those performance bonds required for contaminated parcels noted in (5) above. The original of such bond(s) shall be held by an escrow agent satisfactory to the FGU, fully prepaid, at the expense of the purchaser. In the event any purchaser is a corporate or other entity, the principals of such entity must also execute full-recourse personal guarantees that assure payment of the amount(s) due under performance bonds in the event they are not honored for any reason. Compliance with the terms of the requirements hereof shall be at the sole discretion of the FGU.

This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property. This parcel has been posted as \"Condemned\" by the local building authority. Properties are generally condemned when they are deemed substandard, unsafe, or otherwise unfit for use and habitation. Condemned property must be rehabilitated to meet local building codes prior to use or occupancy. A building is not automatically slated for demolition when condemned. However, this does not necessarily mean that demolition will not also be pursued by the local unit. Please check with the local building official before bidding to determine the specific status and requirements for this property. One or more structures was boarded when we conducted our assessment of this parcel. Properties may be boarded for a variety of reasons. For example, properties are often boarded to prevent trespassers from harvesting copper plumbing, wiring, and other fixtures. Buildings may also be boarded by fire or other officials when they present a safety hazard. We generally do not enter boarded structures and limit our observations to the building's exterior. Likewise, you should limit any inspection of this property to its exterior only. You are not permitted to remove any boarding to view building interiors under any circumstances. Public property records or polite inquiries to neighbors may reveal additional information about a property's history.

One or more structures was boarded when we conducted our assessment of this parcel. Properties may be boarded for a variety of reasons. For example, properties are often boarded to prevent trespassers from harvesting copper plumbing, wiring, and other fixtures. Buildings may also be boarded by fire or other officials when they present a safety hazard. We generally do not enter boarded structures and limit our observations to the building's exterior. Likewise, you should limit any inspection of this property to its exterior only. You are not permitted to remove any boarding to view building interiors under any circumstances. Public property records or polite inquiries to neighbors may reveal additional information about a property's history. This parcel has been posted as \"Condemned\" by the local building authority.

There is some deferred maintenance evident here on the exterior, and its just generally not been well taken care of in a few years. There are some modernization efforts not well executed. Roof is older but stable. Siding and exterior trim is nearing the point where it should be replaced in places or redone. Front porch decking is plywood, and may not be exterior grade. It is delaminating and someone is going to go thru it at some point. It seems as though this was built as a duplex ... but may have been connected and used as a single unit in more recent time. The decor is out of character for the period of the house, bit not insufferable. The kitchens and baths are both spartan and beat up. The house to the east is *very* close.

The home is presently full of a lot of stanky garbage (including food garbage) as well as a family of skunks. There are three bedrooms on the upper floor, with an additional two \"walk thru\" rooms, and (we think) what was a bathroom. The main floor has a room partitioned off into another bedroom that was probably originally the dining room. If you cleaned this one out, it would be a worthy rehab candidate. BUT (there's always a \"but\", isn't there ?) it has a serious foundation issue, especially on the east wall, which has caved right into the basement. We also saw foundation repair to the west wall from a past issue. It may be worth the effort to relocate this structure to a nearby vacant lot, or rebuild the foundation. The electric panel and furnace (which we believe is newer as it has low temp venting) are in the basement, with the skunks, and we didn't want to interrupt them ....

This parcel is part of a site condominium development. A condominium \"unit\" is a form of land ownership which is similar to a traditional subdivision \"lot\" but is also different in some important respects. Each condominium development is laid out in a document called the master deed which outlines the extent and nature of each condominium unit. The master deed also contains rules and restrictions related to construction and permitted use. Construction requirements can include everything from the size or design of buildings to color and orientation on the site. Condominium developments also include \"common elements\" like streets and sidewalks which are shared across all units. Some developments include amenities like golf courses, clubhouses, beaches, pools, and parks whereas others include only basic infrastructure like roads and sidewalks. Site condominiums also include association fees which can be significant. Prospective bidders should carefully review and understand the master deed and investigate association fees prior to bidding.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/110212"},

The property has suffered from deferred maintenance in recently years, and presently is in dire need of a new roof. Portions of the built up roofing can be found on the sidewalk, which means that there are large areas open to the elements. The building is presently condemned by the City of Escanaba, and will need to be brought into compliance with the property maintenance code prior to being occupied. You may wish to check with city code enforcement for their notes. This is a classic property that in addition to lack of maintenance has been the victim of some \"remodeling\" that is out of character with the architecture. Rather than replacing the wood frame windows with suitably sized ones, off-the-shelf vinyl combination windows were used. Inside, some of the original architectural fabric and detail remains, but much has been covered or destroyed. The brick exterior is in solid condition, and even the tuckpoint appears to need little attention. However we do notice erosion of the sandstone trim, especially at sidewalk level, no doubt from snow removal and winter environment.

Damage from freeze bursts can be substantial including significant harm to structural components such as framing and foundations. There is evidence posted which indicates that a lender may be attempting to foreclose upon this parcel after such parcel was foreclosed for delinquent property taxes. A purchaser may encounter future contact from this lender. Tax foreclosure supersedes the rights of mortgage holders. If a mortgage holder does not foreclose upon their mortgage interest prior to tax foreclosure, their right to do so is generally lost. Typically such mortgage holders were provided all necessary notice of tax foreclosure but failed to act in a timely fashion to preserve their interest.

{"title": "Bundle", "comments": "ATTN: No online bidding for this lot. The parcels in this sale unit are grouped, (\"bundled\") as permitted by MCL 211.78m. Many of these include structures which contain lead based paint. Some may contain asbestos. Many are in various stages of disrepair or collapse and are considered dangerous buildings and attractive nuisance. Some may be occupied by tenants-holding-over under law. These parcels are not being offered individually. They must be purchased as a single bundle at or above the minimum bid price, if any is stated. Pursuant to MCL 211.78 (1), the Foreclosing Governmental Unit (FGU) has determined that the most efficient and expeditious method to return many of these parcels to productive use, is to require their immediate demolition, remediation, rehabilitation or repurposing if sold at auction. Many of these parcels constitute blight, a public nuisance and abatement is considered necessary. Before their sale to ANY purchaser at auction, it is the intent of the FGU that any such purchaser shall demonstrate their financial ability and willingness to perform those actions necessary, in the public interest and welfare, to bring the properties into compliance with local codes and ordinances. Therefore, it is a further requirement of sale of the bundled properties that a purchaser must demolish, remediate, rehabilitate or repurpose these properties as follows: 1) ALL STRUCTURES must be secured and made un-enterable within 15 days of sale at auction, at the purchasers sole expense, or the sale shall be cancelled and no refund or deed issued. 2) Any visible refuse, garbage, trash or other cast off shall be removed from lands within 15 days of the sale at auction, at the purchasers sole expense, or the sale shall be cancelled and no refund or deed issued.. 3) The conditions required in (1) and (2) above shall be maintained against further entry or blight for a period of 12 months following the execution of a deed. 4) Those properties in the bundle that are beyond reasonable repair or economic vitality to repair must be demolished at the sole expense of the purchaser. The cost of such work shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. All such demolition must be performed within 6 months of deeding, by a licensed, insured demolition contractor acceptable to the code official of the local unit of government where the property is located. All proper permits for demolition and the removal and disposal of volatile debris (asbestos, contaminants etc) must be obtained. 5) Those properties in the bundle which appear to either the purchaser, FGU or the code enforcement official of the local unit of government to be potentially contaminated, shall be the subject of a Baseline Environmental Assessment (BEA) at the sole expense of the purchaser. The cost of such BEA(s) shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. The BEA(s) shall be conducted by an insured environmental consultant licensed in the State of Michigan within 45 days of purchase, and shall be fully complete and filed with the proper authorities within 90 days of purchase. The level of the BEA to be conducted shall be determined by the findings of the initial phase(s) of the BEA at each parcel subject to such study. Where contamination is evident, the purchaser shall indemnify the FGU with a separate performance bond (issued on the same terms as others herein required) in an amount equal to the full cost of remediation of the contamination at each such site, and for a period of twenty (20) years, unless remediation is undertaken and completed during that time period. If the site is remediated to a level satisfactory to state officials charged with such determinations, the requirement for a performance bond shall be removed for that site. 6) Those properties in the bundle which can be rehabilitated or repurposed shall be brought into compliance with all construction, occupancy, zoning and other use codes of the local unit of government within 12 months. Construction and/or mechanical permits must be obtained prior to performing such work. Occupancy permits must be obtained by the expiration of that term. All construction and rehabilitation work at these properties shall be carried out by contractors that are licensed and insured, and acceptable to the code enforcement officer of the local unit of government. The cost of such work shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. In pursuance of those requirements and their costs and timelines, the FGU is requiring the posting of a performance bond in the amount of $450,000.00. The performance bond shall be made out in favor of the Office of the Bay County Treasurer (acting as the Foreclosing Governmental Unit). Evidence of the issuance and full payment for such bond shall be presented to the FGU within fifteen (15) days of the acceptance of the purchasers bid at auction. In the event evidence of issuance and full payment is not tendered within fifteen (15) days of sale, the sale shall be cancelled outright, and the purchaser considered non-responsive to a necessary condition of the sale. No receipt for the sale shall be issued, and the bidder shall not be entitled to enter upon such premises, until such bond is issued and deemed sufficient by the FGU. Such bond shall be issued by an underwriter licensed to do business in the State of Michigan, who is not the subject of any pending disciplinary action by the State of Michigan or any department, bureau or commission thereof. It shall be payable, in full amount, to the FGU in the event of either whole or partial non-performance of the terms above written for its entire duration. It shall run as effective and be fully pre-paid, for the entire term of twenty-four (24) months. Any overage or refund shall be payable to the purchaser upon earlier termination of the bond because of full performance hereunder. This 24 month time period is not applicable to those performance bonds required for contaminated parcels noted in (5) above. The original of such bond(s) shall be held by an escrow agent satisfactory to the FGU, fully prepaid, at the expense of the purchaser. In the event any purchaser is a corporate or other entity, the principals of such entity must also execute full-recourse personal guarantees that assure payment of the amount(s) due under performance bonds in the event they are not honored for any reason. Compliance with the terms of the requirements hereof shall be at the sole discretion of the FGU.

{"title": "Fantastic View Parcel! Grand Marais", "comments": "If you've ever dreamed of owning a waterfront parcel on Lake Superior, HERE IT IS. Only one problem. Most of it has already slid off the bluff ... or its already underwater ! The road shown on the map (Lake Superior Trail) is long gone. Somewhere out to sea and not coming back. Every year a few more feet slide away. We don't know exactly how much of this lot is still even left, but it would be a losing proposition to build here. It may not even be enough to set up a tent on. But you're welcome to survey it and find out. The last owner noted \"Abandoning - not much left\" when they decided not to pay the taxes. Also (just a FYI) the road to this parcel from the rear (Sandy Lane) was not built this far west. Its covered with trees ... so it's walk-in traffic only. In theory this lot has 153' feet along the water facing boundary and runs a couple hundred feet deep, We don't think there is much left.

The minimum bid includes all delinquent taxes, interest, penalties, and fees that were due on the property at the time of foreclosure. See MCL 211.78m(5) for more information. The roads which are shown on plat or tax maps for this parcel do not appear to exist or may be located in a different location than shown on such maps. While a legal right to build such roads may remain, this construction would likely be very expensive. However, in some instances these unimproved roads have been vacated or abandoned by action of the local government and no such right to construct the roads remains. Issues surrounding unimproved roads can be complicated and expensive to resolve. You should investigate the existence of any roads and the ability to access this parcel thoroughly before bidding. This parcel appears to have challenging terrain. Challenging terrain can include steep hillsides, ravines, gullies, or similar topographical features as well as little to no buildable area. Such parcels often have no practical use.

At the time of our last visit we were not able to view the interior This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property. Mobile homes (and some modular homes) can be separately titled and considered personal property. In these instances, there may be third parties that have the legal right to remove that mobile home from the parcel whether or not it has been assessed as part of the property in the past.

{"title": "Modern 100 Room Hotel. Restaurant. Bar.", "comments": "Built in 1978 as a Holiday Inn, and most recently operated as a TraveLodge franchise. For some information about the property when it was operating, see https://www.wyndhamhotels.com/travelodge/houghton-lake-michigan/travelodge-houghton-lake/overview .This is a substantial, well built facility, and not a beat up old HoJo that is obsolete and worn out. This property has been closed for some time, with only the restaurant in business at the end of its life. It is a boilerplate Holiday Inn floorplan design of that period and size, with a 1600 square foot partitionable conference room, the atrium and pool in the center area between dual, 50 room east and west 2 story room groups. (25 rooms lower and 25 upper on each side). The west group of rooms appears to have been upgraded in perhaps the last 10 years or so, and there is still serviceable carpet and some furnishing here. The bathroom vanities have been modernized as well, but need touchup in some rooms. The east wing has been stripped, and most of the climate control units for individual rooms have been removed. The carpet has also been taken up in the east wing, but the floors have not been scraped in the hallways. It would appear that the last operator may have been in the upgrade process, but walked away without completing it. We did find isolated spots where the clearly was freeze damaged plumbing which has resulted in pockets of mold in 5 or 6 of the individual hotel rooms in the west group. At the time of our visit in June of 2018, there was still water in toilets, which indicates that this building has not had the plumbing winterized, so there will certainly be some effort necessary there to bring that system back to life ... but damage did not appear to be widespread. This building is fully fire sprinkled. We did locate mostly complete mechanical drawings/blueprints which we have left on the front counter for the benefit of a new owner. Individual rooms are heated by thru-wall units. Most are missing in the east wing, and those in the west wing appear to be present. Condition unknown. The overall building HVAC is by rooftop natural gas forced air air handling units that appear to all be present, as are the ventilation and make up air units for the kitchen cooking exhaust hoods. Electrical service here is very substantial and adequate for the use of the property. There is an 800A 480V main and many many subpanels properly located throughout the premise. The pool and spa are still partially filled, and a bit GREEN, but the equipment that we located appeared intact and merchantable. The acoustic drop-in ceiling will need a refresh in some locations where it is down ... not sure why ... The roof appears to be generally sound and there were no substantial leaks evident anywhere in the building. The outside fa\u00c3\u00a7ade and grounds are tired, but this was a well built property and would be worthy of a rehab and fresh landscape. The parking lot could stand a resurfacing, and it has a substantial sign exposure that includes modern LED electonics. The kitchen and bar at the east side of the building, were the last parts of the property operated, and the hard-wired fixtures (sinks, walk-in coolers, dishwasher, vent hoods) are all still in place and presumably merchantable. Most of the portable coolers and better line equipment and smalls are gone or of low grade and scattered about. There is at least 30 lineal foot of range hood capacity. The kitchen appears to be generally in conformance with modern health department requirements, but you'll want to talk to the local sanitarian about his most recent inspection results here and what specific requirements he (or she) has regarding reopening this food service operation. Most importantly, the reputation of this property will need rehabilitation as well. During one of its most recently incarnations, it served as a \"medical school\" for foreign students and wasn't really operating as a daily room operation much at all. This could be a great opportunity for a well financed hotel operator to pick up the basic property for far far less than the cost of building new. With the proper investment and facelift/reimaging, this property has the \"bones\" in place to again be a contributing member of the lodging community in Houghton Lake.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/107713"},

Located on a county maintained paved road. This property (last we knew) is still occupied by a relative of the former owner. There are a half dozen inoperable vehicles, campers, boats etc... scattered around. The barn styled building appears to be at least partially used as a living quarters. We are told there is no running water here ... not sure if there is active power or not ... or if there is a well or maybe issues with either or both. This property has potential, but will need some cleanup. Quiet country setting. The previous owner of this parcel undertook a construction or rehabilitation project which has not been completed. We have attempted to describe the degree to which the project has been finished, but the building should be be considered incomplete nonetheless. The local building code enforcement official may be able to offer additional insight as to why the project was never completed. This property is occupied.

Three teeny tiny bedrooms. Teeny tiny kitchen. Weak floors in spots that would do well to be resurfaced with plywood. Hot water baseboard heat, but we assume its junk from freezing. The electrical service to this home is GONE. WE assume it may have been located on the (now demolished) garage (?). Older room doesn't leak (yet) but she's headed that way. Smells like a litterbox upstairs. We'd view this one as 4 walls to start over with. It's gonna need all the mechanicals updated. Parcel is situated in a highly visible spot on Old 27 in Waters near several thriving businesses. The building here has noticeable sway in the roof from a distance. Inside the building is a train wreck. The roof is still up (somehow), but the ceiling is down, including the frame and roof bracing. The center of the building is slab on grade, but the south addition has a crawlspace or basement under it, and that has caved in at a couple different locations. There are a few salvageable fixtures here (cooler doors, vent hood, sinks) but not worth the burden. This parcel has TWO UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS still in place according to state records we found, and the cost of removing them will be the financial responsibility of a purchaser. THIS CAN BE A HUGE EXPENSE AND CAN PASS THROUGH TO THE OWNERS OF ANY SHELL COMPANIES. Short version: Unless you have the desire and wherewithal to remove the building AND the tanks legally and properly, this is not likely to be anything other than a huge headache. State of Michigan UST Facility number 00018840. This parcel may contain buried storage tanks from previous use as a gas station or similar enterprise. Our analysis is based solely on visual inspection of the property surface as further detailed in the lot description. The State of Michigan may require a new owner to remove any remaining tanks and remediate environmental concerns at their sole expense. Additional information may be available from the MDEQ Storage Tank Database. You should conduct careful and thorough research prior to bidding on this parcel. This parcel has substantial structural issues caused by poor design, insufficient maintenance, or both. Such buildings may be subject to condemnation orders which we were unable to locate during our inspection. All such buildings should be brought into compliance with local building regulations prior to use. We strongly recommend that you contact the local building code official and consider consulting a competent structural engineer to assess the condition of this property before to bidding. This parcel includes a structure which should be considered DANGEROUS. This building has suffered structural damage which creates substantial risk of harm from falling through damaged areas or collapse from above. It may also contain extensive debris which could fall or collapse, rusty nails, broken glass, and other hazards. You are not permitted to enter this or any other structure offered at tax sale. You should limit your inspection only to what can be safely observed from the building's exterior. Trespassers are subject to prosecution.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/107661"},

{"title": "Teeny Tiny Vacant Parcel On Old 27", "comments": "This parcel is roughly 50'x50' in size. Probably too small to build on. It may not even have road access. Neighbors driveway may encroach. Has a power pole on or near it. A great wedding or birthday present for that special someone in your life. This parcel is too small to be practically useful under most circumstances. Many times such parcels are the result of survey or property transfer errors which create small orphaned slivers of land. These parcels are frequently too small to allow construction or any other practical use. They often have no road frontage or legal means of access. These parcels can often lead to adverse claims or encroachments by neighboring land owners which can be complicated legal issues to resolve. Please investigate this parcel thoroughly prior to bidding. This parcel does not front on a public or privately deeded improved road. Often times there are easements in the recorded chain-of-title that provide legal access to such parcels but other times there are not. You should thoroughly research this parcel's access rights prior to bidding.

The roads which are shown on plat or tax maps for this parcel do not appear to exist or may be located in a different location than shown on such maps. While a legal right to build such roads may remain, this construction would likely be very expensive. However, in some instances these unimproved roads have been vacated or abandoned by action of the local government and no such right to construct the roads remains.

The south 1/3rd or so of the property is wooded, with the center open and occupied by a natural gas production setup. Dry buildable lands with no indications of wetlands that we saw, and USGS topo maps confirm this. We do not study mineral rights ... if the last owner of the surface held them ... they're included. If they did not ... we do not convey any interest in them except for reversionary rights (if any) under the dormant mineral act. In some cases, a party other than the surface land owner may own the right to explore for and remove oil, natural gas, and other minerals from a property. Such \"severed\" mineral rights generally include the right to enter upon the surface of the land in order to prospect or remove minerals located beneath the surface. If you are purchasing property of any substantial size (over a few acres), you may wish to investigate whether the mineral rights are included in the sale or if they have been severed and are owned by third parties. Significant mineral interests are held by the State of Michigan. Information about mineral interests held by the State can be found here. Even if not owned by the State, mineral rights may have been sold to third parties or retained by a previous owner. Oil, gas, and other severed mineral interests are not affected by property tax foreclosure. Furthermore, due to the complicated nature of mineral abstracting, such severed interests have not been examined during the foreclosure process. Severed mineral interest are not included as part of this sale. If the mineral interests have not been severed, such interests are included.

The deer told me this is their favorite place to go eat in the area. There is a trail that runs around the perimeter of the property, though it is a bit overgrown from lack of use. We made it about two thirds of the way to the rear along the west property line. To the best of our ability to see it, we found no improvements on this property other that a natural gas station on the front of the parcel. The status of mineral rights is not studied ... but if they were with the surface at foreclosure, they are conveyed ... and if they weren't, they not. We marked the approximate location of the NE and NW corners along the road with pink survey tape. 1320' on the road x 2640' deep. The land rolls gently downhill to the rear, but we saw no indicators of any wetlands anywhere that we travelled and the USGS maps indicate the same. This is all nice, well drained buildable land.

We do not check mineral rights ... but if they're still vested with the surface rights here, that could be worth the price of admission alone. A visual inspection of this parcel indicates that it contains a crop or planting which may have been made by a third party. These can range from single year crops like corn or grain to items such as christmas trees or other nursery stock which require more than one year to mature before harvest. Any third party lease has been voided through the foreclosure process. However, these situations can become points of potential litigation. In an effort to prevent dispute, the Foreclosing Governmental Unit will often grant single year farmers the right to harvest their crop as a condition of sale.

Our synopsis is that this is probably a really solid little place, but we're not gonna know until someone brave cleans it out.

In these instances, there may be third parties that have the legal right to remove that mobile home from the parcel whether or not it has been assessed as part of the property in the past. We make no representations or warranties as to whether such mobile or modular homes are included with the real property offered for sale. It is the buyer\u2019s responsibility to conduct their own research as to the state of title. As a preliminary step, it may be useful to determine if an Affidavit of Affixture of Manufactured Home has been executed and recorded as outlined in MCL 125.2330i. You may wish to consult a licensed attorney or title company to assist in this research.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/105924"},
{"title": "Ten Acres Near Tower / Afton", "comments": "A rectangular ten (330x1320) located past the end of Kisser Road on a shared two track. Parcel is to the right a few hundred feet after the end of the public road, and begins roughly where you find the old camper back in the woods (look for the orange tape marker on the driveway leading to the camper). It runs south 330 feet along the private road to a point where another narrower road runs west. BE ADVISED that this trail has nowhere to turn around and is mucky about 500 feet back in. Great place for some newbie to get stuck ... so we advised WALKING in this route at least until the weather dries this up. Nicely wooded lands ... the USGS topographical maps indicate that this is all uplands, but you should walk it yourself to be certain. Nice property !!!

{"title": "2+ Acre Parcel Near Mullett Lake!", "comments": "This is a nicely wooded, level, dry, sandy soiled, well drained 2+ acre parcel. It is located on a private road near the SE corner of Mullett Lake off East Mullet Lake Road. Most of the other parcels here are larger/acreage (5-10 acre average) and have newer rural housing with a lot of modular homes in the area. We do not believe this to be a county maintained road, and it is likely either communal effort or there may be a looseknit owners association that maintains it in the winter season. It does not appear to be graded on a regular basis. We have put the auction signs up twice (removed within a day by a neighbor thinking YOU won't see this posting) so we'll tell you how to find it ! Enter Muscott Trail from either the north or the south end ... and look for the parcel with the electric fence and critters. This parcel is NORTH (left) of that, and is in between it and the camper and storage building further north. It has roughly 211 feet along the road and runs 418 feet deep to the east from the road.

{"title": "Summer Cottage With Great View Of Mullett Lake In Topinabee!", "comments": "This one will need some work to bring back to usefulness, but it holds potential. The roof edge has been in poor condition (probably for decades), and the south edge has some serious decay in the soffits. The cottage was built on wood pier footings, and decay to that is also evident based on the sloping and weakened floor system inside. The kitchen (at the rear end) is particularly distressed, with the structure improving in condition as you move toward the front/lake side. This will need a new roof and roof decking, some roof joists replaced (south and west) and you'll have to open up the floor and see what's needed down there in the way of stabilizing and straightening the floor system. Short version: This one will need a lot of work, and if you hire it out it'll probably exceed the value of the finished project ... but it may make sense for the skilled owner-rehabber. Before doing anything (like bidding ?) we'd suggest having a good conversation with the code enforcement people (the building inspector) AND the people with the health department. We did not see either the well or the septic and have no idea how old, or in what condition they might be. This is the kind of property that has several neighbors paying attention (that would probably like to see it torn down). So you'll want to get the right permits, dot the i's and cross the t's as you go along. There are 2 bedrooms and a bath, natural gas service with space heat. We did not locate the panelboard but suspect this is 60A service. It is located in summery Topinabee, just west of Mullett Lake, on the hillside right behind the Marathon Station. There is a vacated (?) street to the east/lake side that adds to the front yard. This property has a great thru-the-trees view of Mullett Lake from a hillside vantage. Could be a dream cottage ... or a nightmare ! Do your homework on this one !!!", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/105919"},

{"title": "9+ Acres With Log Home ... Near Mullett Lake!", "comments": "Estate sized parcel could easily support a nice pole barn, gardens and still have a woodlot left over ! Located less than 500 feet from Mullett Lake on the north end, right in the old money blueblood neighborhood west of the river channel. Of the 9+ acre parcel, we believe about 5 acres of it is wooded ... the entire thing is level. There are some pockets of \"moist\" land here and there, but its generally useable land. The home is probably 80 years old and full log construction. It appears to be in salvageable condition. We saw some decay, but it was not horrid at all based on a cursory examination. (We didn't probe, we just looked). The home has a full basement of masonry construction, but it was waist deep in water ... which is what happens when you turn the power off and your basement is normally serviced by a sump pump. So there will be some cleanup to do here. We did not see any evidence of mold having formed from this water accumulation, but it is certainly a possibility as summer trudges along. Three bedrooms. One bath. 60A electric service (did not find the panel ... probably down below) and bottle gas at present, tho natural gas appears to be available at the street within a short distance. The original structure has a rear addition .. all of it has sloping and weaving floors which will require some inspection and correction from the basement. There is a large classic garage building on the property that appears to be restorable. Also a couple of small sheds (bath-with-a-path ?) in the vicinity. Bring your own Sears catalogue and clean up. We did not see the well or pump (again ... probably in the basement) and there is some modern septic evidence suggesting that the two holer is just yard art now. This could be a really sharp property in the hands of the right rehabber. Just a spitting distance from Cheboygan shopping and dining.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/105916"},

Three bedrooms, attached garage and a second shop/garage building with wood heat. There is a good amount of debris here to remove ... mostly inert (clothing, furniture castoffs) but there is some food garbage as well. Overall this is structurally sound, but wet, stinky and full of rubbish. Roof isn't horribly old and appears to have a lot of life left in it. Dog run attached to garage. The garage doors all need attention. Aluminum siding on house. Double lot 120x132 in size. Could be a nice home again with some work. Last occupancy about December 2016. This property contains physical indications that one or more water lines have frozen, ruptured, and leaked for a significant period of time prior to being shut off. Such indications can include damage to ceilings and floors and visibly damaged pipes and fixtures. Damage from freeze bursts can be substantial including significant harm to structural components such as framing and foundations. There is evidence posted which indicates that a lender may be attempting to foreclose upon this parcel after such parcel was foreclosed for delinquent property taxes. A purchaser may encounter future contact from this lender. Tax foreclosure supersedes the rights of mortgage holders. If a mortgage holder does not foreclose upon their mortgage interest prior to tax foreclosure, their right to do so is generally lost. Typically such mortgage holders were provided all necessary notice of tax foreclosure but failed to act in a timely fashion to preserve their interest. In rare instances it may be necessary to cancel a sale if a deficiency in notice to such a lender is discovered. Please contact us or ask questions at the sale if you have concerns about this issue.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/105914"},

The decking is ooold and a couple of the posts have serious deflection. This house is clean, tight and has had mechanical upgrades of a modest nature. Old 60A electric service. Some newer pex water lines seen. Kitchen and rear portion have had a new subfloor put down.

{"title": "Mechanic Or Repair Shop Building. Cheboygan.", "comments": "Right on the main drag, US 23 heading east toward Rogers City from Cheboygan. Still has some personal property belonging to the last owner here. Originally a service station, most recently a muffler/brake/hitch/welding shop. WE would HIGHLY recommend having a baseline environmental assessment done here immediately after purchase as there is very likely contamination potential here. Several oil drums around the backside and soils and the building interior are grease burdened. Steel roof. Highly visible commercial location on a US highway. The interior of this property was not viewed during our inspection. Buildings which are dangerous, occupied, boarded, condemned, or otherwise difficult to enter are inspected from the exterior/curbside only. You are NOT authorized to enter these or any other buildings offered for sale. You should limit your inspection to that which can be made safely from the building's exterior. This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property. A visual inspection of this parcel indicates potential environmental contamination. Visual indicators can include things like used tires, dirty soils, or chemically intensive former uses such as dry cleaning. Prospective bidders should carefully research the condition of this property prior to bidding. You may with to contact the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality or other relevant state agencies for additional guidance. Purchasers are strongly advised to obtain a Baseline Environmental Assessment (BEA). Some basic information about BEA can be found here. All sales are made as/is where/is without any representations or warranties. It is the sole responsibility of the purchaser to identify and appropriately handle any environmental contamination that may exist.

This parcel does not have public road frontage, and is located about 300 feet east of Decheau Lake Road. Access to a rustic cabin (in poor condition) is via a well site access road off M-33 North, south of Rouse Road.

We're not sure if they are still held by a third party, or if they've reverted to the surface owner, but because of the active natural gas production activity around here, its unlikely that they have reverted under the Michigan Marketable Title Act. USGS topographical surveys indicate that this is level, wooded, DRY land. If you're chasing this one, you'll want to verify the mineral rights (if that is important to you) as well as deeded easement rights to the property, if any exist. Our visual inspection indicated that electrical service was not available on or near this parcel. The nearest electric service appeared to be a considerable distance (hundreds or perhaps thousands of feet) from the property. As such, electrifying this parcel could be costly.

Often times there are easements in the recorded chain-of-title that provide legal access to such parcels but other times there are not. You should thoroughly research this parcel's access rights prior to bidding. It can require expensive, complicated, and time consuming legal proceedings to secure legal access to landlocked parcels that do not have easements for ingress and egress. In some cases, a party other than the surface land owner may own the right to explore for and remove oil, natural gas, and other minerals from a property. Such \"severed\" mineral rights generally include the right to enter upon the surface of the land in order to prospect or remove minerals located beneath the surface. If you are purchasing property of any substantial size (over a few acres), you may wish to investigate whether the mineral rights are included in the sale or if they have been severed and are owned by third parties. Significant mineral interests are held by the State of Michigan. Information about mineral interests held by the State can be found here. Even if not owned by the State, mineral rights may have been sold to third parties or retained by a previous owner. Oil, gas, and other severed mineral interests are not affected by property tax foreclosure. Furthermore, due to the complicated nature of mineral abstracting, such severed interests have not been examined during the foreclosure process. Severed mineral interest are not included as part of this sale. If the mineral interests have not been severed, such interests are included. However, it is the sole responsibility of a prospective purchaser to determine the state of any mineral interests associated with this property prior to bidding. Seller makes no representations or warranties regarding the state of title to any mineral interests associated with this parcel.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/107179"},

Frequently homes are located on one parcel and the associated back or side-yard is located on a separate adjacent parcel. These side-yards are sometimes foreclosed while the home is not. This can create unfortunate situations where fenced boundaries, septic tanks, out buildings, garages, and other improvements that were previously associated with the home next door are sold on their own.

{"title": "Great Home Site In Berry Creek Valley!", "comments": "Site condo lot in Berry Creek Valley site condo development at the east side of Emmet County. About a half dozen newer homes here. Nice quality development in a growing area! This parcel is part of a site condominium development. A condominium \"unit\" is a form of land ownership which is similar to a traditional subdivision \"lot\" but is also different in some important respects. Each condominium development is laid out in a document called the master deed which outlines the extent and nature of each condominium unit. The master deed also contains rules and restrictions related to construction and permitted use. Construction requirements can include everything from the size or design of buildings to color and orientation on the site. Condominium developments also include \"common elements\" like streets and sidewalks which are shared across all units. Some developments include amenities like golf courses, clubhouses, beaches, pools, and parks whereas others include only basic infrastructure like roads and sidewalks. Site condominiums also include association fees which can be significant. Prospective bidders should carefully review and understand the master deed and investigate association fees prior to bidding.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/106093"},

{"title": "Older Home In East Jordan.", "comments": "When we were by here in late May, this home appeared to still be occupied. An assortment of personal property and vehicles are still on the premises. Older two story wood frame house. Roof is mid-life and appears to be generally okay. Soffits and trim could use a little maintenance ... a paint job and some cleanup and this might look pretty nice. Siding (wood) is in decent condition from a roadside view. WE did not have the ability to view this one up close due to occupancy. The interior of this property was not viewed during our inspection. Buildings which are dangerous, occupied, boarded, condemned, or otherwise difficult to enter are inspected from the exterior/curbside only. You are NOT authorized to enter these or any other buildings offered for sale. You should limit your inspection to that which can be made safely from the building's exterior. This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property. This property is occupied. Please respect the privacy of current occupants and limit any inspection to what can be safely observed from the road.

{"title": null, "comments": "Classic summer home at Torch Lake Village, where land narrows to just a few hundred feet between the north end of Torch Lake to the east and Lake Michigan to the west. You can walk to either from here without much sweat. This was probably a great summer home at hone time, but it's been pretty much lobotomized. Most of the original fabric and finish inside is gone, and many of the partition walls have been removed, leaving little clue as to the original floor plan. The upside is that it is now very \"open floor plan\" and could be arranged a number of ways. However you may want to have an expert study the workmanship and design engineering here ... its hard to say if anything integral to the integrity of the whole has been removed improperly. The upper roof is steel. There is an addition along the US 31 road side that is of newer materials and has a newer shingle roof. The porch roof is shot and needs re-decking and shingling. There is missing siding, and the mechanicals are pretty much gone .... so new wiring, plumbing and HVAC are needed. There is a decent outbuilding at the side street and an old mobile home that is of little value. The yard is bunkered and could use a thorough clean-out and cleanup. Much of the material used in this project appears to have been re-purposed and second hand. Again ... you'll want to consult with some professionals on how to best bring this one back to glory. The previous owner of this parcel undertook a construction or rehabilitation project which has not been completed. We have attempted to describe the degree to which the project has been finished, but the building should be be considered incomplete nonetheless.

{"title": "Cute Chalet In Lakes Of The North!", "comments": "This is a sharp little place in Lakes of the North, very close to the winter sports area of the development. 3 bedrooms (2 down, 1 up), 2 baths. Sunken living room with woodburning fireplace. Attached (but not interior connected) 1.5 car garage. Electric baseboard heat. Has a cerad shake roof that is probably original to the 1980-ish date of the home. No visible leaks. We did see some woodpecker damage to siding. Inside its fresh and not spotless but a coat of paint and new floorcovering in the kitchen and you're good to go. A note inside says \"water is drained\" ... and while we can't garn-tee that work, it shows intent. This could be a great northern getaway !

{"title": "Occupied Home On 2+ Acres Near Elk Lake!", "comments": "Home is overgrown and hard to get a good look at, but to the best of our knowledge, it is still occupied. Appears to be a fairly decent modular home and an oversized 2+2 car garage. Large 2+ acre lot on the corner of Cherry Avenue and Bussa Road. A short hop to the lake from here ! The interior of this property was not viewed during our inspection. Buildings which are dangerous, occupied, boarded, condemned, or otherwise difficult to enter are inspected from the exterior/curbside only. You are NOT authorized to enter these or any other buildings offered for sale. You should limit your inspection to that which can be made safely from the building's exterior. This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property. This property is occupied. Please respect the privacy of current occupants and limit any inspection to what can be safely observed from the road. Some occupants may be upset or angry and may meet contact with aggression or violence. Please use discretion and caution when researching this or other occupied properties. Furthermore, although this property has been foreclosed for unpaid taxes, occupants have certain rights under Michigan law and must be formally evicted if unwilling to leave voluntarily. You may wish to consult a licensed attorney for more information.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/105394"},

{"title": "Older 2 Bedroom Mobile Home. Lakes Of The North!", "comments": "Older two bedroom (one is tiny) mobile on a nice wooded lot in Lakes of the North. Has a roofover and appears to be generally dry and solid. It's an older one, so a little tight, but would work well as a weekender or starter/retirement place. Floors are solid. Ceiling has been removed ... not sure why unless they were planning to drywall it (?). We suspect there is a little plumbing to do here as most of it in the bathroom is exposed. Worthy of your attention if you're looking for a project that won't break the bank ! See the LONA website link for association details. Mobile homes (and some modular homes) can be separately titled and considered personal property. In these instances, there may be third parties that have the legal right to remove that mobile home from the parcel whether or not it has been assessed as part of the property in the past. We make no representations or warranties as to whether such mobile or modular homes are included with the real property offered for sale. It is the buyer\u2019s responsibility to conduct their own research as to the state of title. As a preliminary step, it may be useful to determine if an Affidavit of Affixture of Manufactured Home has been executed and recorded as outlined in MCL 125.2330i. You may wish to consult a licensed attorney or title company to assist in this research.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/105346"},

{"title": "Ten Acres. Private Lake. Tillie Lakes Area / Mancelona", "comments": "This is a ten acre parcel that is 597 x 736 feet in size. There is an easement road to this parcel, about 1000 feet east of Darragh Road on the south side of Musser Road (see attached survey - Easement \"A\"). It may be the opinion of other landowners in the area that this is a \"private road\" (and it is), but this parcel (Parcel \"10\" on the survey) is clearly a beneficiary of that access. We're thinking that the SE quarter of this parcel is likely to be open water and/or marshlands at the present time. There are several \"Tillie Lakes\" shown here on various topo maps, but at present the water levels are high enough that they are all one body of water. Various websites indicate that there is excellent largemouth bass and panfish to be captured here. This is a PRIVATE LAKE and only adjoining property owners have a right to be here. It does not have \"public\" access, as the state owns none of the surrounding parcels. This parcel does not front on a public or privately deeded improved road. Often times there are easements in the recorded chain-of-title that provide legal access to such parcels but other times there are not. You should thoroughly research this parcel's access rights prior to bidding. It can require expensive, complicated, and time consuming legal proceedings to secure legal access to landlocked parcels that do not have easements for ingress and egress.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/105329"},

{"title": "50+ Acres In The Grass River Natural Area. Occupied Home.", "comments": "Note: access to this parcel is provided over an abandoned railroad right-of-way that we do *not* guarantee title to. This is an OCCUPIED home that needs a considerable amount of work. It's located in the Grass River Natural area, near the south end of Clam Lake. The property along the road is well fenced. We did not get a good look at the structure as it is still occupied and there are dogs at the property as well. The lands are dense and brushy, and we suspect the backside is likely to be marshy thicket and excellent Sasquatch and mosquito habitat. The parcel is triangular in shape and has substantial frontage along Comfort Road, which is a well traveled paved county thrufare between Bellaire and Alden. The home here will need considerable work. This property is occupied. Please respect the privacy of current occupants and limit any inspection to what can be safely observed from the road. Some occupants may be upset or angry and may meet contact with aggression or violence. Please use discretion and caution when researching this or other occupied properties. Furthermore, although this property has been foreclosed for unpaid taxes, occupants have certain rights under Michigan law and must be formally evicted if unwilling to leave voluntarily. You may wish to consult a licensed attorney for more information. The interior of this property was not viewed during our inspection. Buildings which are dangerous, occupied, boarded, condemned, or otherwise difficult to enter are inspected from the exterior/curbside only. You are NOT authorized to enter these or any other buildings offered for sale. You should limit your inspection to that which can be made safely from the building's exterior.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/105294"},

Older mobile home is currently OCCUPIED although an eviction is in process and may be complete by sale date. Because of the occupancy we did not have the opportunity to see this one up close, but it appears from curbside to have been well maintained over time. This property has been the subject of litigation up to and including the Michigan Court of Appeals, which rule in favor of the county. With that being completed and judgment issued, title insurance should be fairly straightforward on this one. This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property.

The mobile home here has been vandalized (broken windows, holes in walls) before the last occupants left. Stinky and garbage strewn, but repairable. The value here is in the 4\" submersible well, septic, power service and land. To access this parcel, come up the extension of 96th Avenue off Buchanan Road. At a point a few hundred feet off the road, a driveway runs west, and access to our parcel is to the right ... a sandy two track that runs straight north (see photo). This is almost 4WD road. This trail comes into the parcel from the SE corner. You will see pink survey tape along 96th at the approximate SE and NE corners of the 10 acres. There is a driveway running off 96th due west toward the north end of the parcel and that is where the trailer is located. There is an incomplete frame addition started to the rear that has been sitting unfinished for several years. You'll want to review this for suitability to complete or tear off. The previous owner of this parcel undertook a construction or rehabilitation project which has not been completed. We have attempted to describe the degree to which the project has been finished, but the building should be be considered incomplete nonetheless. The local building code enforcement official may be able to offer additional insight as to why the project was never completed. This property has been subject to vandalism by former occupants or other parties. Typical damage includes broken windows, holes in walls, broken doors and doorjambs, and other damage which can add to the cost of repair and rehabilitation. You should conduct your own research prior to bidding on this parcel.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/108430"},

{"title": "Modular Unit On Site Condo Lot - Has Minor Mold Issues - Shelby!", "comments": "3BR 2BA modular home on a site condo lot in the Golden Pond site condo. We noticed a number of holes on the wall here and have determined that there is some mold working its way up from the crawlspace and this was someones way to see its rate of spread. The home was closed up for months (or longer) as the former owner was in nursing care. The mold damage that we saw was moderate. This one is restorable, but not a weekend project. There are deed restrictions and association fees/membership requirements here that you will want to be up to speed on before bidding. This parcel is part of a site condominium development. A condominium \"unit\" is a form of land ownership which is similar to a traditional subdivision \"lot\" but is also different in some important respects. Each condominium development is laid out in a document called the master deed which outlines the extent and nature of each condominium unit. The master deed also contains rules and restrictions related to construction and permitted use. Construction requirements can include everything from the size or design of buildings to color and orientation on the site. Condominium developments also include \"common elements\" like streets and sidewalks which are shared across all units. Some developments include amenities like golf courses, clubhouses, beaches, pools, and parks whereas others include only basic infrastructure like roads and sidewalks. Site condominiums also include association fees which can be significant. Prospective bidders should carefully review and understand the master deed and investigate association fees prior to bidding. This building contains evidence of mold. Mold is an indication of excess moisture which can come from a variety of sources including high ground water, improper sealing of foundation walls, damaged roofs, and other conditions which can be expensive to correct. Mold can pose significant health risks and, if extensive, may require a complete renovation which could exceed the value of the building. Please conduct your own research and bid accordingly.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/108428"},
{"title": "Parcel And Mobile That Has Legal Access Issues.", "comments": "Parcel is 120' wide x 330' feet deep. It has NO legal access to road frontage at this time. There IS a legal easement to the property that shares the driveway with the property to the northeast (presently for sale) HOWEVER where that easement runs west to this parcel from the driveway is covered by the south 15 feet of the home on that parcel. In other words, the easement to this parcel has the neighbors house sitting on top of it. The rest of the neighbors here do NOT want you driving across their property to get to this one. Sooooooooooooo there isn't any way to get to this. If you could, there is an older mobile here that (so far) has a good roof and is merchantable. The well is bad we are told, and there is no septic system here ... or if there is, it's no good. Detached garage and storage shed as well as a camper to which we have no title. You will need to negotiate or litigate for access to this. There is a good amount of bad blood over this easement issue in this area, and that may not be a certain outcome. The roads which are shown on plat or tax maps for this parcel do not appear to exist or may be located in a different location than shown on such maps. While a legal right to build such roads may remain, this construction would likely be very expensive. However, in some instances these unimproved roads have been vacated or abandoned by action of the local government and no such right to construct the roads remains. Issues surrounding unimproved roads can be complicated and expensive to resolve.

The land is level for most of its surface, but drops sharply to the creek at the east side ... the creek is probably 20 feet below the road grade there.

{"title": "Great Rehab Potential - Ludington", "comments": "Older frame construction home in Ludington. Appears to have been a bank repo and winterized. Nice corner lot. No developed offstreet parking (but there is room). Has been \"remodeled\", but with some odd design choices. Two bedrooms on the main floor (one is narrow/small). The upper floor has been opened into a loft with an odd bathroom in a sloped ceiling closet type room. Home has numerous (probably 4-5-6) layers of roofing on it. There is some decay at the soffits and corners. If it were ours, we'd rip it all off, put in some large dormers and add some quality space upstairs. There is something funky going on with the kitchen floor where the sink is located ... it drops a few inches. We suspect there is freeze damaged plumbing in a few spots here ... and we're not sure at all what the deal is with the kitchen floor is ... but you'll want to fix it. The basement entrance is from outside. Newer forced air NG furnace. 100A electrical that has some questionable workmanship you'll want to have checked out. Aluminum siding circa 1960. This is a solid home in a great neighborhood. Walking distance to one of the best beaches in the state. This one is worth a full-on rehab effort. This property contains physical indications that one or more water lines have frozen, ruptured, and leaked for a significant period of time prior to being shut off. Such indications can include damage to ceilings and floors and visibly damaged pipes and fixtures. Damage from freeze bursts can be substantial including significant harm to structural components such as framing and foundations. There is evidence posted which indicates that a lender may be attempting to foreclose upon this parcel after such parcel was foreclosed for delinquent property taxes. A purchaser may encounter future contact from this lender. Tax foreclosure supersedes the rights of mortgage holders. If a mortgage holder does not foreclose upon their mortgage interest prior to tax foreclosure, their right to do so is generally lost. Typically such mortgage holders were provided all necessary notice of tax foreclosure but failed to act in a timely fashion to preserve their interest. In rare instances it may be necessary to cancel a sale if a deficiency in notice to such a lender is discovered.

There is also a healthy dose of more in the basement. There was so much in those two areas that the true condition of the place is difficult to really grasp, but it seems to be straight and solid. We think (but can't guarantee) that if you hold your nose and clean this out, its likely to be very restorable with a resurfacing and attention to the mechanicals (some of which we could not get to). The roof is older, but we did not see leaks inside. This property is unsanitary and poses a potential health hazard because of raw food garbage, backed up sewer lines, or other similar waste. Such conditions can attract rodents, wild animals, and other vermin. You should bid accordingly and be prepared to mitigate the situation immediately upon purchase.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/106981"},

Please investigate this parcel thoroughly prior to bidding. This parcel is what we refer to as a 33'/66'. We frequently see foreclosed parcels that are either 33 or 66 feet wide. These parcels are often a result of existing or former road rights of way. A common road right of way is 66 feet wide. Half of that is 33 feet. There are two common scenarios that we see. Scenario 1: A land owner splits a tract of land and creates a common easement parcel for access. They might then quit paying taxes on the parcel with road frontage knowing that the easement would remain even after foreclosure. Such easements are generally either 33 or 66 feet wide. Scenario 2: Rural land generally runs to the center of any public road on which it fronts whereas subdivided land usually runs to the edge of the road right-of-way. Sometimes during surveys or other splits, half of the right-of-way (usually 33 feet) can become orphaned, effectively turning to no-man's-land. Potential bidders should be aware that 33 and 66 foot wide parcels are very likely to include easements. That means that there are people who have a right to use the property even though they do not own the land. It is unlawful to cut off access over a 33 or 66 foot parcel where an easement already exists.

As far as we can tell the property is heated with a single boiler, which appears to be well past replacement age and condition. The two immediate needs here are a new roof and HVAC upgrade. The roof is deteriorated, but really only substantially affects the two bathrooms that are in the center-rear of the second floor. The chimney has also tipped over and scattered itself all over the roof below. Inside, the units are solid and have almost all of their original fabric (trim, hardwood floors, stained glass windows) intact. Kitchens and baths are old and could stand upgrading.

You reach it via M-28&gt;County Road 502&gt;County Road 510. The road to this area is washboard grade in areas and while it is reachable by a regular car, don't expect to travel much above 30 mph. The property does not front on any improved road, public or private, and getting to it would be difficult. The SW corner of the parcel is closest to access, being about 250' away from CR 510. However this facade is one that rises in elevation dozens of feet in a sort distance, and the terrain is that of vegetated, rocky, very steep hillside. USGS topographical maps indicate that the approach from the south is much more gradual in rise, but a visual inspection of this area indicates that much of it is impassable because of areas of bog and marsh. Maps also show a trail here off CR 510, but we saw no such path around that location. The ground here has substantial areas of huge rock outcroppings, and the center of the parcel appears to be a high plateau on top of a big rock. IF you engineer access to the top of this parcel, it would likely be a stunning setting for a unique home. But getting there would be quite the challenge. Power is 5 miles away from this location.

It's location almost makes it likely that it may have served as a hotel or Inn at one time.

The lower level was \"remodeled\" mid century and has drop ceilings, paneling and shag carpet. It has been fairly well maintained. The second floor is almost untouched by time since its original design, with the exception of some framing that introduced several smaller rooms (bedrooms) where there was once just a huge second floor lodge or hall type use originally. We theorize that some historical research will indicate that the original use of the whole building was originally commercial. The basement foundation has been rebuilt in the rear ... probably in the last 40 years ... and the building is on solid footing. What it does need ASAP is a roof. There is daylight showing around the chimney and it's leaking. It has not yet caused major damage, but it will given time. There are two ooooold fusebox power services here, and the lower unit is still active. It was quite a surprise to walk in and find the TV set on in an otherwise dark building.

There is some cave in of the foundation on the south side of the home here. We looked at it below, and it is in a crawlspace, not in the partial basement. So there is some prospect for excavating it and reinforcing it if the footings themselves are good. There are 3 bedrooms up and one down, with a bathroom on each floor. Kitchen isn't anything special, but it's merchantable. The front south side room here is unfinished. It was probably half of the living room at one time but has been partitioned off. Not sure what that plan was. Aluminum siding and a newer natural gas forced air furnace ... but that begs the question \"where is the gas meter\" ? We saw no evidence of any fuel supply .... The previous owner of this parcel undertook a construction or rehabilitation project which has not been completed. We have attempted to describe the degree to which the project has been finished, but the building should be be considered incomplete nonetheless. The local building code enforcement official may be able to offer additional insight as to why the project was never completed. The foundation of one or more buildings located on this parcel appears to be failing. Correcting foundation issues can be very expensive and issues are often more complex than they initially appear.

The building is approximately 50' x 140' in dimension, which equals roughly 7,000 square feet per floor. The property has suffered from deferred maintenance in recently years, and presently is in dire need of a new roof. Portions of the built up roofing can be found on the sidewalk, which means that there are large areas open to the elements. The building is presently condemned by the City of Escanaba, and will need to be brought into compliance with the property maintenance code prior to being occupied. You may wish to check with city code enforcement for their notes. This is a classic property that in addition to lack of maintenance has been the victim of some \"remodeling\" that is out of character with the architecture. Rather than replacing the wood frame windows with suitably sized ones, off-the-shelf vinyl combination windows were used. Inside, some of the original architectural fabric and detail remains, but much has been covered or destroyed. The brick exterior is in solid condition, and even the tuckpoint appears to need little attention. However we do notice erosion of the sandstone trim, especially at sidewalk level, no doubt from snow removal and winter environment. This is a classic property begging for a deep pocketed visionary to rescue it. One or more buildings on this parcel has a roof which is either leaking to the interior or appears close to failure. Failing roofs often indicate substantial structural decay inside the building. You should investigate the integrity of this structure(s) prior to bidding.

{"title": "248+ Acres Near Laurel Lake!", "comments": "We don't often get LARGE ACREAGE like this ... but here is 248.91 acres of estate grade primitive wilderness ! This includes two tax parcels, with 2640' feet of frontage on Laurel Lake Trail. The parcel is roughly rectangular, 2640' north to south, and 3960' east to west. Aerial maps suggest that there is a trail along the entire south boundary from Laurel Lake Trail that winds around the eastern boundary as well, and also runs along the quarter section line north-to-south as well as a few other spurs. The eastern third of this parcel has some marshland veins creeping in from the nearby Tahquamenon River. The wildlife habitat here is exceptional. If you're looking for a remote, primitive estate or private hunting camps location, THIS IS IT. There is no power here, and isn't likely to be any in our lifetime outside of local generator source. We spent several hours looking for the \"way in\" to this property ... and we got to within a few hundred feet of the road, only to be stopped by gated roads coming in from the SW. There is likely a way in from the north on a seldom-used trail, but it was underwater because of recent rains, and we're not sure if our AAA card does any good way out here. Access from the east is stopped by the Tahquamenon River, and from the south by marshlands and the Gimlet Creek that are between it and Gimlet Lake Trail. The most promising entry appears to be Skyline Trail &gt; north on Charcoal Grade Road &gt; east on Laurel Lake Trail (1st major right hand road after Gimlet Lake Trail) . Most of the probable routes we can see on aerial maps are quite overgrown and/or swampy on the ground. Summer weather may mitigate this issue, or there may be a right to use the gated road in from the SW. You may want to have some easement research done prior to bidding. Fair warning: The roads here have many areas that will we pretty rough on anything less than a 4WD vehicle. There is a good amount of rutted roads and some washout right now.

{"title": "200' Of Waterfrontage On The St Marys River. In The \"black Hole\".", "comments": "As far as we can determine, there is no physical road access to this 1 1/2 acre waterfront parcel on Neebish Island. You'll want to investigate whether there is legal access at all. According to a neighbor, the road in from the north across Neebish Island Resort is a private drive and there is no easement to properties further south from it. There is a muddy trail shown on maps, but it's difficult to see that it looks like it's ever been anything more than just rustic access. There are no other structures back in this area. The Franklin Landing strip is to the west of this parcel ... and it is also privately owned. We are told that water access here would be difficult except by kayak and airboat, as the waterfrontage is cattails (not very motorable) and is known locally as the \"Black Hole\". Several tax sale buyers that ventured into this area were abducted by Sasquatch and are now his forever Euchre partners. Our visual inspection indicated that electrical service was not available on or near this parcel. The nearest electric service appeared to be a considerable distance (hundreds or perhaps thousands of feet) from the property. As such, electrifying this parcel could be costly.

Our review of this parcel indicates that the noted State Equalized Value (SEV) does not appear to reflect the current value of the property. This is often due to buildings or other improvements being demolished or fire damaged or other similar items included in the SEV being removed from the property. It can also be due to market changes in the area in which the property is located. It should be further noted that the SEV/assessed value of the parcel as noted in this listing may be several years old. You should consult a local real estate professional or appraiser to help you assess the current market value of this property before bidding and should not base your valuation on the stated SEV.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/105951"},
{"title": "40 Acres On Neebish Island!", "comments": "A great recreational parcel or second home location on the southern end of Neebish Island ! It's a square 40 with 1320' along the west side of Brander Road. You can either access the parcel from that boundary, or drive into the center of it from South Perry Drive (not marked with a road sign), which runs off Brander about 1/4 mile north of the parcel. When coming in from Perry Road, the property line is marked with one of our auction signs on a tree that also has a hunk of survey tape around it. There is also a small deer blind near this boundary, on the parcel to the north (see photos). There are several old campers and some other general debris at a campspot here. We do not have title to the trailers and are not including them in the sale. A lot of what is left around here looks like it would burn, but you'll have some left over to haul away. The land here is generally wooded and level. Some spots are a little damp, but we did not see any substantial marshlands on it, and the USGS topographical maps confirm that suggestion. Maps indicate a road also comes in from the south, but it appears to cross the property of another landowner that has posted his parcel. When we tried driving further south on Perry Drive from the campspot area, there were trees down across the road, so we didn't investigate further. This is a nice recreational parcel on an island serviced by ferry. Neebish is less developed than Sugar or Drummond Island. There IS power in this area, but not in the center of the parcel. You'll want to study the distance and/or talk to the utility provider about power to the portion of the land that you would want to build on.

{"title": "Rehabbers Special In Rudyard.", "comments": "This was a cute little place in its day. With some effort it could be that again. 3 bedrooms and one bath, all on the upper level. Maple floors worthy of refinishing, and coved ceilings on the main floor. The last folks here were apparently working on patching the plaster. There is some evidence of settling in the foundation in the SE corner, and the west wall along the road. There are cracks here that have allowed moisture in, and an effort has been made to seal with with foam insulation. There is also some heaving in the floor at the north wall. None of the walls show signs of bowing or deflection ... just the cracks. We suspect the soils here are moist, and freezing may have lead to the crack and seepage. This may not be a big problem as is, or it could worsen. It does not appear that any foundation issues have transmitted themselves upward in the form of crooked floors. City water here. The carport to the south side is an add-on and to some degree detracts from the character of the house, but does serve useful function. The roof does not appear to be old, and there are no visible signs of leakage, but it looks a little shady. The furnace *would* be forced air ... but they took it with 'em when they left, so you'll need a new one. This parcel appears to have been subject to harvesting of electrical, plumbing, mechanical systems, or other building components. Buildings are sometimes targeted by criminals that steal or \"harvest\" items such as copper plumbing, wiring, furnaces, water heaters, fixtures, hardwood flooring, etc. This building should be considered incomplete due to such harvesting and may require substantial investment to reequip. The foundation of one or more buildings located on this parcel appears to be failing. Correcting foundation issues can be very expensive and issues are often more complex than they initially appear.

Each condominium development is laid out in a document called the master deed which outlines the extent and nature of each condominium unit. The master deed also contains rules and restrictions related to construction and permitted use. Construction requirements can include everything from the size or design of buildings to color and orientation on the site. Condominium developments also include \"common elements\" like streets and sidewalks which are shared across all units. Some developments include amenities like golf courses, clubhouses, beaches, pools, and parks whereas others include only basic infrastructure like roads and sidewalks. Site condominiums also include association fees which can be significant. Prospective bidders should carefully review and understand the master deed and investigate association fees prior to bidding.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/108185"},

{"title": "Private Road.", "comments": "This parcel contains a private road. It's 50 feet wide by 1320 feet (1/4 mile) long. It is commonly known as N Schneider Road. This is a private, seasonal road and not county maintained. It serves several properties to the west. It is probable that there are easements over this parcel. This parcel is what we refer to as a 33'/66'. We frequently see foreclosed parcels that are either 33 or 66 feet wide. These parcels are often a result of existing or former road rights of way. A common road right of way is 66 feet wide. Half of that is 33 feet. There are two common scenarios that we see. Scenario 1: A land owner splits a tract of land and creates a common easement parcel for access. They might then quit paying taxes on the parcel with road frontage knowing that the easement would remain even after foreclosure. Such easements are generally either 33 or 66 feet wide. Scenario 2: Rural land generally runs to the center of any public road on which it fronts whereas subdivided land usually runs to the edge of the road right-of-way. Sometimes during surveys or other splits, half of the right-of-way (usually 33 feet) can become orphaned, effectively turning to no-man's-land. Potential bidders should be aware that 33 and 66 foot wide parcels are very likely to include easements. That means that there are people who have a right to use the property even though they do not own the land. It is unlawful to cut off access over a 33 or 66 foot parcel where an easement already exists. Even if an easement doesn't already exists, courts will frequently create such an easement to prevent a neighboring parcel from becoming landlocked. Potential bidders should consider that this parcel likely has little value and cannot be used to landlock a neighboring parcel when there is no other path for ingress and egress. This parcel is accessible by a road that is believed to be a seasonal or non-maintained public road. While we make no representations or warranties as to the precise nature of such road access, our research suggests that this road is either 1) Not regularly graded; and/or 2) Not snow plowed in winters; and/or 3) Appears subject to fallen trees or other events which have not been addressed by the county road commission. You should conduct your own research into this issue prior to bidding.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/108177"},

Please check with the local building official before bidding to determine the specific status and requirements for this property.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/108017"},
{"title": "Large Family Size Home In Moorestown. Indoor Pool !", "comments": "Parcel fronts 296 feet along the north side of the Moorestown Road and runs 449 feet deep. There is a large 3 bedroom / 1 bath home here with a barrier free ramp to the front door. It has an addition to the rear which houses an enclosed pool. This is a large, well constructed, solid home that is messy and full of leftovers and garbage, but the basic structure does not need a lot of work inside. The front/home portion has a woodburning fireplace and galley style kitchen, and there is a massive flagstone fireplace in the pool as well, with a third unit also located there which appears to have been designed for indoor BBQ activities. There is a full basement under the front (house) section of the building only, and its heated by bottle gas forced air heat. The pool does not appear to have been used in a few years, and we cannot be certain of its operability or condition, other than noticing that the heater and filter appear to be intact. The pool is quite deep in the center and has a diving board at one end. There is a shower facility at one end of this room, but someone poked a hole thru the concrete block wall, and it appears to have found repurposing as a pet quarters of some kind (?). This addition is served by an air handling unit (AHU) on the roof for management of humidity and air temperature. There is also two car garage here, that requires some attention to the overhead doors, as well as an additional large steel outbuilding that is uninsulated storage. Both outbuildings have concrete floors. Overall the property needs some updating and maintenance. Steel roof on the home is newer, but the shingle roof on the rear (pool) addition looks as though it could use replacement. Overall this is a large, well appointed solid home, that needs to be cleaned out and resurfaced. We'd advised a new roof to the rear.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/108454"},
{"title": "Older Decaying Cabin Near Keelans Corner", "comments": "Parcel fronts 50' along the north side of Newman Road, just east of 8 Mile, and runs 100' deep. There is a long abandoned cabin here with a roof that has large holes in it. No power, water or septic, tho there could be an old well here somewhere. Could it be saved ? Probably. But you'll have some work to do. One or more buildings on this parcel has a roof which is either leaking to the interior or appears close to failure. Failing roofs often indicate substantial structural decay inside the building. You should investigate the integrity of this structure(s) prior to bidding.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/107130"},

Has 51.85 feet on Michigan and runs 140.25 feet deep, wrapping around behind the little green house next door (not included). We can't be positive, but the architecture here *strongly* suggests that this may have been a gas station 100 years ago ... and gas stations mean UNDERGROUND TANKS ... and those are a possible source of contamination. It is NOT listed as being a tank location on the DNR Enviromapper, but they didn't keep records until the 1970's and this building, if it had tanks at all, would have been 50 years before that. The inside here really isn't too bad, and its larger than it looks, but the living room (front room) floor is really weak, indicating that maybe there is insufficient construction or perhaps even rot. We are also told that the second floor (really dangerous stairway to that area) was an \"apartment\". But it can't possibly be very large. This building is probably best torn down. But it's not beyond repair either. This parcel may contain buried storage tanks from previous use as a gas station or similar enterprise. Our analysis is based solely on visual inspection of the property surface as further detailed in the lot description. The State of Michigan may require a new owner to remove any remaining tanks and remediate environmental concerns at their sole expense. Additional information may be available from the MDEQ Storage Tank Database. You should conduct careful and thorough research prior to bidding on this parcel.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/107494"},

The roof here looked sketchy, but the only active leak appears to be in the rear entryway. When the power went off, so did the sump pump ... and now the basement is flooded. There is something funky going on at the SW corner of the house (right rear corner looking at it from the front) The floors in this corner slop noticeably, and there is a hole in the ground with some drain pipe running into it (sump pump maybe ?). There is some washout. Because we couldn't get into the basement to examine the foundation from the inside, you'll have to cut back the brush outside to get a good gander at what is causing that corner to sway a little.

There is some deferred maintenance evident here on the exterior, and its just generally not been well taken care of in a few years. There are some modernization efforts not well executed. Roof is older but stable. Siding and exterior trim is nearing the point where it should be replaced in places or redone. Front porch decking is plywood, and may not be exterior grade. It is delaminating and someone is going to go thru it at some point. It seems as though this was built as a duplex ... but may have been connected and used as a single unit in more recent time. The decor is out of character for the period of the house, bit not insufferable. The kitchens and baths are both spartan and beat up. The house to the east is *very* close.

The home is presently full of a lot of stanky garbage (including food garbage) as well as a family of skunks. There are three bedrooms on the upper floor, with an additional two \"walk thru\" rooms, and (we think) what was a bathroom. The main floor has a room partitioned off into another bedroom that was probably originally the dining room. If you cleaned this one out, it would be a worthy rehab candidate. BUT (there's always a \"but\", isn't there ?) it has a serious foundation issue, especially on the east wall, which has caved right into the basement. We also saw foundation repair to the west wall from a past issue. It may be worth the effort to relocate this structure to a nearby vacant lot, or rebuild the foundation. The electric panel and furnace (which we believe is newer as it has low temp venting) are in the basement, with the skunks, and we didn't want to interrupt them .... The plumbing here is likely bad, as we noticed heaving in the floor which is a typical aftereffect of frozen burst pipes. Parcel fronts 200' along the south side of Center Street.

The kitchen is dated, but classic rustic in style and fits the decor of the rest of the house perfectly. It has a good roof, and bottle gas forced air heat. Our concerns with this one are primarily in the basement. We're not ready to call this a \"bad foundation\", but there are a couple of cracks in the west wall, and the inner east wall has some deflection. However the east wall imperfections are not visible to us on the outside of the house, and it may be buttressing or just the way it was built that looks unusual inside ... from the exterior the east wall looks absolutely normal. The basement floor is heaved, but this is not uncommon where the concrete was thin, the water table high, and the house unheated in winter.

Still has a rotary dial phone on the wall in the kitchen. Roof is older, but does not leak. The piping to and from the boiler is missing ... not sure if they recycled the metal or if it was intentional to make the property less habitable. We did notice that the place was barricaded like a fort and quite difficult to access. Also BEWARE the basement stairs were intentionally cut (every other tread) so that if you're headed down them in the dark, you're going to get to the bottom in a hurry. Danger Will Robinson ! The home was modernized mid-century and is still tasteful and clean, even if a bit dated. It screams \"Grandmas house\". There is a two car attached garage as an outbuilding that needs some work but could conceivably become a small studio or work space. Overall this one is straight and solid.

{"title": "11.6 Acres Near Chassel! Sharp Home And Garage, Cabins At Roadfront.", "comments": "This is a great property in a highly desirable resort/vacation area ! The property here consists of three parcels, with 275' frontage on the west side of US 41 just north of Chassell ... and running about 1825' to the west. That's roughly 11.6 acres by our calculations. There is a great mid-century ranch style home here, which we presume to be a cabin from an earlier period with an addition. It is vinyl sided and has a steel roof, both of which are in merchantable condition. The home has 2 bedrooms and a bath, and is slab on grade with a crawlspace under the original cabin area. Electric service is an older 60A fusebox. Heat is hot water, natural gas boiler. To our knowledge this property was heated and occupied through spring 2018. The interior features period touches such as cedar closets and a turquoise ceramic tiled kitchen. It could use some freshening of flooring and a little paint, but there isn't much here that is in need of immediate attention as far as we can tell. Hardwood (oak) floors. Woodburning fireplace set up with heat-a-lator channels. There are several other buildings here, including a 2 car detached garage with mother-in-law apartment (the steps to the upper level are in poor condition) ... an \"A-frame\" garage ... and 2 ooooold cabins down the hill at the roadfront. The south/left roadfront cabin is roached. The roof joists themselves are rotten to the point of failure. The north/right cabin is dirty and stinky, but structurally worth salvaging. We did investigate back into the property behind the main house where a road runs into the woods. A creek crosses the property and effectively makes the road difficult to access by vehicle. We did not believe there to be any \"accumulations\" or other improvements back there, so we assume it to be just wooded property. USGS maps indicate that it is all uplands and not marsh or swamp. They also indicate that the elevation of the property RISES almost 100 feet from the main house to the back end of the parcel, so we assume that it is at least as \"dry\" as it is at the front.

Given the physics of water damage, the upper floor (which we didn't risk trying to get to) is probably even worse. This one may make sense for a neighbor to purchase, but given the market for storefronts in this region (many are available in better shape at attractive prices) this does not make a good speculation target. This parcel has substantial structural issues caused by poor design, insufficient maintenance, or both. Such buildings may be subject to condemnation orders which we were unable to locate during our inspection. All such buildings should be brought into compliance with local building regulations prior to use. We strongly recommend that you contact the local building code official and consider consulting a competent structural engineer to assess the condition of this property before to bidding.

The concept here is removal of the second floor to introduce high, high cathedral ceilings in the front section of the house, with a loft over what we presume was to be the kitchen (?) for a bedroom sleeping area. This would be a cool plan to follow thru with. It isn't much to look at, but it appears to be generally sound, and like we said ... the worst of the demo work and the roof are done. Just shy of an acre in lot size, with 72 feet on the road and a depth of 488 feet. There is a garage out back that is beyond help and needs to go. There are no mechanicals, power or fixtures here.

The power service here has been dropped, often an indication that the local code enforcement people have condemned it. You may want to verify its status. 2 tiny bedrooms. The furnace has been harvested. Electrical service is ancient. This parcel has substantial structural issues caused by poor design, insufficient maintenance, or both. Such buildings may be subject to condemnation orders which we were unable to locate during our inspection. All such buildings should be brought into compliance with local building regulations prior to use. We strongly recommend that you contact the local building code official and consider consulting a competent structural engineer to assess the condition of this property before to bidding.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/105505"},
{"title": "Occupied Home In Baraga. Updated 1.5 Story", "comments": "Updated bungalow style 1.5 story home in Baraga. This home was OCCUPIED at the time of our visit, so we did not get a real close look at it. Vinyl sided and some newer windows and doors. The roof looks like it is nearing the end of its lifespans and probably needs replacement soon. We'd be surprised if it does not leak now. Lot fronts 50' on Girard Avenue and runs 160 feet deep. This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property. This property is occupied. Please respect the privacy of current occupants and limit any inspection to what can be safely observed from the road. Some occupants may be upset or angry and may meet contact with aggression or violence. Please use discretion and caution when researching this or other occupied properties. Furthermore, although this property has been foreclosed for unpaid taxes, occupants have certain rights under Michigan law and must be formally evicted if unwilling to leave voluntarily. You may wish to consult a licensed attorney for more information. The interior of this property was not viewed during our inspection. Buildings which are dangerous, occupied, boarded, condemned, or otherwise difficult to enter are inspected from the exterior/curbside only. You are NOT authorized to enter these or any other buildings offered for sale. You should limit your inspection to that which can be made safely from the building's exterior.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/105504"},
{"title": "Two Adjoining Parcels Off Indian Cemetery Road. L'anse Township. ", "comments": "This sale includes two parcels, each 208.75' (east-west) x 417.5' (north-south). Each parcel is 2 acres. Together, the parcels measure 208.75' x 835'. These parcels have no public road frontage, and there is no clear easement of record. They're located behind and east of 16179 Indian Cemetery Road, and there is an access drive that shows on maps ... going through property under the control of the former owner of these parcels that is populated with cars, trucks, boats and other memorabilia ... we have no idea if they will consent to access. So you may have an access issue with these parcels ... This parcel does not front on a public or privately deeded improved road. Often times there are easements in the recorded chain-of-title that provide legal access to such parcels but other times there are not.

The Silver River is churning over rocks and a sand/gravel bottom. Certainly a perfect habitat for the wily trout. All that's missing from this picture is your new cabin ! The five acre parcel is on BOTH sides of Indian Road as well as BOTH sides of the river ! Access is simplest from Indian Road, but you can also steal some views of the river by taking Arvon Road (to the north) and coming in from the other side on Conservation Road. The land is beautifully wooded in a variety of specie including some magnificent maples. USGS topographical maps do not indicate any marshland here ... it should be all uplands with a number of building locations possible. Power and phone are both at the road !!", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/105501"},

This parcel includes structures which have been damaged by fire. It is up to the auction purchaser to determine if this property can be restored to a safe condition and to comply with all relevant local regulations and building codes. Please research thoroughly prior to bidding. This parcel has been posted as \"Condemned\" by the local building authority. Properties are generally condemned when they are deemed substandard, unsafe, or otherwise unfit for use and habitation. Condemned property must be rehabilitated to meet local building codes prior to use or occupancy. A building is not automatically slated for demolition when condemned. However, this does not necessarily mean that demolition will not also be pursued by the local unit. Please check with the local building official before bidding to determine the specific status and requirements for this property. This parcel includes a structure which should be considered DANGEROUS. This building has suffered structural damage which creates substantial risk of harm from falling through damaged areas or collapse from above. It may also contain extensive debris which could fall or collapse, rusty nails, broken glass, and other hazards. You are not permitted to enter this or any other structure offered at tax sale.

{"title": "Large Older Frame Home. Multi-Family Use. Evart. Restrictions Apply", "comments": "At one time this was likely a splendid, large family home. Then it was lobotomized into four or maybe FIVE \"apartments\". It's begging for you to restore it to its former glory, as a large well manicured family home. There are separate electric and gas meters. We did not view all of the units because of the number of lock changes involved, but we did see the upper units and the lower ones thru the windows. As you might expect, the floor plans are odd, the surfaces old and in need of a refresh, and the heat almost exclusively wall space heaters. There is some evidence of roof leakage, mostly older and repaired ... but a couple of \"fresh\" ones. There is municipal water and sewer here. Corner lot, directly across the street from the Evart Middle School. There is a small home to the rear/west of this property that \"looks\" like it was probably under common ownership and management, but our cipherin' says that its not on this parcel. The building on this property appears to have been used for multi-family occupancy in the past based upon indicators such as multiple mailboxes, entrances, numbering, layout, or other such factors. Modifications to the property may NOT have been legally made and may NOT conform to local zoning.

This is often due to buildings or other improvements being demolished or fire damaged or other similar items included in the SEV being removed from the property.

It should be further noted that the SEV/assessed value of the parcel as noted in this listing may be several years old.

{"title": "Note Parcel Size ", "comments": "This parcel is too small to be practically useful under most circumstances. Many times such parcels are the result of survey or property transfer errors which create small orphaned slivers of land. These parcels are frequently too small to allow construction or any other practical use. They often have no road frontage or legal means of access. These parcels can often lead to adverse claims or encroachments by neighboring land owners which can be complicated legal issues to resolve. Please investigate this parcel thoroughly prior to bidding. This parcel is what we refer to as a 33'/66'. We frequently see foreclosed parcels that are either 33 or 66 feet wide. These parcels are often a result of existing or former road rights of way. A common road right of way is 66 feet wide. Half of that is 33 feet. There are two common scenarios that we see. Scenario 1: A land owner splits a tract of land and creates a common easement parcel for access. They might then quit paying taxes on the parcel with road frontage knowing that the easement would remain even after foreclosure. Such easements are generally either 33 or 66 feet wide. Scenario 2: Rural land generally runs to the center of any public road on which it fronts whereas subdivided land usually runs to the edge of the road right-of-way. Sometimes during surveys or other splits, half of the right-of-way (usually 33 feet) can become orphaned, effectively turning to no-man's-land. Potential bidders should be aware that 33 and 66 foot wide parcels are very likely to include easements. That means that there are people who have a right to use the property even though they do not own the land. It is unlawful to cut off access over a 33 or 66 foot parcel where an easement already exists. Even if an easement doesn't already exists, courts will frequently create such an easement to prevent a neighboring parcel from becoming landlocked. Potential bidders should consider that this parcel likely has little value and cannot be used to landlock a neighboring parcel when there is no other path for ingress and egress.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/107054"},

In these instances, there may be third parties that have the legal right to remove that mobile home from the parcel whether or not it has been assessed as part of the property in the past. We make no representations or warranties as to whether such mobile or modular homes are included with the real property offered for sale. It is the buyer\u2019s responsibility to conduct their own research as to the state of title. As a preliminary step, it may be useful to determine if an Affidavit of Affixture of Manufactured Home has been executed and recorded as outlined in MCL 125.2330i. You may wish to consult a licensed attorney or title company to assist in this research. This parcel has been posted as \"Condemned\" by the local building authority. Properties are generally condemned when they are deemed substandard, unsafe, or otherwise unfit for use and habitation. Condemned property must be rehabilitated to meet local building codes prior to use or occupancy. A building is not automatically slated for demolition when condemned. However, this does not necessarily mean that demolition will not also be pursued by the local unit. Please check with the local building official before bidding to determine the specific status and requirements for this property. This parcel includes a structure which should be considered DANGEROUS. This building has suffered structural damage which creates substantial risk of harm from falling through damaged areas or collapse from above. It may also contain extensive debris which could fall or collapse, rusty nails, broken glass, and other hazards. You are not permitted to enter this or any other structure offered at tax sale. You should limit your inspection only to what can be safely observed from the building's exterior. Trespassers are subject to prosecution.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/106902"},

Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property.

{"title": "Bundle", "comments": "ATTN: No online bidding for this lot. The parcels in this sale unit are grouped, (\"bundled\") as permitted by MCL 211.78m. Many of these include structures which contain lead based paint. Some may contain asbestos. Many are in various stages of disrepair or collapse and are considered dangerous buildings and attractive nuisance. Some may be occupied by tenants-holding-over under law. These parcels are not being offered individually. They must be purchased as a single bundle at or above the minimum bid price, if any is stated. Pursuant to MCL 211.78 (1), the Foreclosing Governmental Unit (FGU) has determined that the most efficient and expeditious method to return many of these parcels to productive use, is to require their immediate demolition, remediation, rehabilitation or repurposing if sold at auction. Many of these parcels constitute blight, a public nuisance and abatement is considered necessary. Before their sale to ANY purchaser at auction, it is the intent of the FGU that any such purchaser shall demonstrate their financial ability and willingness to perform those actions necessary, in the public interest and welfare, to bring the properties into compliance with local codes and ordinances. Therefore, it is a further requirement of sale of the bundled properties that a purchaser must demolish, remediate, rehabilitate or repurpose these properties as follows: 1) ALL STRUCTURES must be secured and made un-enterable within 15 days of sale at auction, at the purchasers sole expense, or the sale shall be cancelled and no refund or deed issued. 2) Any visible refuse, garbage, trash or other cast off shall be removed from lands within 15 days of the sale at auction, at the purchasers sole expense, or the sale shall be cancelled and no refund or deed issued.. 3) The conditions required in (1) and (2) above shall be maintained against further entry or blight for a period of 12 months following the execution of a deed. 4) Those properties in the bundle that are beyond reasonable repair or economic vitality to repair must be demolished at the sole expense of the purchaser. The cost of such work shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. All such demolition must be performed within 6 months of deeding, by a licensed, insured demolition contractor acceptable to the code official of the local unit of government where the property is located. All proper permits for demolition and the removal and disposal of volatile debris (asbestos, contaminants etc) must be obtained. 5) Those properties in the bundle which appear to either the purchaser, FGU or the code enforcement official of the local unit of government to be potentially contaminated, shall be the subject of a Baseline Environmental Assessment (BEA) at the sole expense of the purchaser. The cost of such BEA(s) shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. The BEA(s) shall be conducted by an insured environmental consultant licensed in the State of Michigan within 45 days of purchase, and shall be fully complete and filed with the proper authorities within 90 days of purchase. The level of the BEA to be conducted shall be determined by the findings of the initial phase(s) of the BEA at each parcel subject to such study. Where contamination is evident, the purchaser shall indemnify the FGU with a separate performance bond (issued on the same terms as others herein required) in an amount equal to the full cost of remediation of the contamination at each such site, and for a period of twenty (20) years, unless remediation is undertaken and completed during that time period. If the site is remediated to a level satisfactory to state officials charged with such determinations, the requirement for a performance bond shall be removed for that site. 6) Those properties in the bundle which can be rehabilitated or repurposed shall be brought into compliance with all construction, occupancy, zoning and other use codes of the local unit of government within 12 months. Construction and/or mechanical permits must be obtained prior to performing such work. Occupancy permits must be obtained by the expiration of that term. All construction and rehabilitation work at these properties shall be carried out by contractors that are licensed and insured, and acceptable to the code enforcement officer of the local unit of government. The cost of such work shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. In pursuance of those requirements and their costs and timelines, the FGU is requiring the posting of a performance bond in the amount of $450,000.00. The performance bond shall be made out in favor of the Office of the Bay County Treasurer (acting as the Foreclosing Governmental Unit). Evidence of the issuance and full payment for such bond shall be presented to the FGU within fifteen (15) days of the acceptance of the purchasers bid at auction. In the event evidence of issuance and full payment is not tendered within fifteen (15) days of sale, the sale shall be cancelled outright, and the purchaser considered non-responsive to a necessary condition of the sale. No receipt for the sale shall be issued, and the bidder shall not be entitled to enter upon such premises, until such bond is issued and deemed sufficient by the FGU. Such bond shall be issued by an underwriter licensed to do business in the State of Michigan, who is not the subject of any pending disciplinary action by the State of Michigan or any department, bureau or commission thereof. It shall be payable, in full amount, to the FGU in the event of either whole or partial non-performance of the terms above written for its entire duration. It shall run as effective and be fully pre-paid, for the entire term of twenty-four (24) months. Any overage or refund shall be payable to the purchaser upon earlier termination of the bond because of full performance hereunder. This 24 month time period is not applicable to those performance bonds required for contaminated parcels noted in (5) above. The original of such bond(s) shall be held by an escrow agent satisfactory to the FGU, fully prepaid, at the expense of the purchaser. In the event any purchaser is a corporate or other entity, the principals of such entity must also execute full-recourse personal guarantees that assure payment of the amount(s) due under performance bonds in the event they are not honored for any reason. Compliance with the terms of the requirements hereof shall be at the sole discretion of the FGU. Seen better days. Sits very low to the ground. Newer siding and roof .

{"title": "Small Occupied Garage ", "comments": "On our last visit in Mid June this property was occupied This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property. This property is occupied. Please respect the privacy of current occupants and limit any inspection to what can be safely observed from the road. Some occupants may be upset or angry and may meet contact with aggression or violence. Please use discretion and caution when researching this or other occupied properties.

{"title": "Bundle", "comments": "The parcels in this sale unit are grouped, (\"bundled\") as permitted by MCL 211.78m. Many of these include structures which contain lead based paint. Some may contain asbestos. Many are in various stages of disrepair or collapse and are considered dangerous buildings and attractive nuisance. Some may be occupied by tenants-holding-over under law. These parcels are not being offered individually. They must be purchased as a single bundle at or above the minimum bid price, if any is stated. Pursuant to MCL 211.78 (1), the Foreclosing Governmental Unit (FGU) has determined that the most efficient and expeditious method to return many of these parcels to productive use, is to require their immediate demolition, remediation, rehabilitation or repurposing if sold at auction. Many of these parcels constitute blight, a public nuisance and abatement is considered necessary. Before their sale to ANY purchaser at auction, it is the intent of the FGU that any such purchaser shall demonstrate their financial ability and willingness to perform those actions necessary, in the public interest and welfare, to bring the properties into compliance with local codes and ordinances. Therefore, it is a further requirement of sale of the bundled properties that a purchaser must demolish, remediate, rehabilitate or repurpose these properties as follows: 1) ALL STRUCTURES must be secured and made un-enterable within 15 days of sale at auction, at the purchasers sole expense, or the sale shall be cancelled and no refund or deed issued. 2) Any visible refuse, garbage, trash or other cast off shall be removed from lands within 15 days of the sale at auction, at the purchasers sole expense, or the sale shall be cancelled and no refund or deed issued.. 3) The conditions required in (1) and (2) above shall be maintained against further entry or blight for a period of 12 months following the execution of a deed. 4) Those properties in the bundle that are beyond reasonable repair or economic vitality to repair must be demolished at the sole expense of the purchaser. The cost of such work shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. All such demolition must be performed within 6 months of deeding, by a licensed, insured demolition contractor acceptable to the code official of the local unit of government where the property is located. All proper permits for demolition and the removal and disposal of volatile debris (asbestos, contaminants etc) must be obtained. 5) Those properties in the bundle which appear to either the purchaser, FGU or the code enforcement official of the local unit of government to be potentially contaminated, shall be the subject of a Baseline Environmental Assessment (BEA) at the sole expense of the purchaser. The cost of such BEA(s) shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. The BEA(s) shall be conducted by an insured environmental consultant licensed in the State of Michigan within 45 days of purchase, and shall be fully complete and filed with the proper authorities within 90 days of purchase. The level of the BEA to be conducted shall be determined by the findings of the initial phase(s) of the BEA at each parcel subject to such study. Where contamination is evident, the purchaser shall indemnify the FGU with a separate performance bond (issued on the same terms as others herein required) in an amount equal to the full cost of remediation of the contamination at each such site, and for a period of twenty (20) years, unless remediation is undertaken and completed during that time period. If the site is remediated to a level satisfactory to state officials charged with such determinations, the requirement for a performance bond shall be removed for that site. 6) Those properties in the bundle which can be rehabilitated or repurposed shall be brought into compliance with all construction, occupancy, zoning and other use codes of the local unit of government within 12 months. Construction and/or mechanical permits must be obtained prior to performing such work. Occupancy permits must be obtained by the expiration of that term. All construction and rehabilitation work at these properties shall be carried out by contractors that are licensed and insured, and acceptable to the code enforcement officer of the local unit of government. The cost of such work shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. In pursuance of those requirements and their costs and timelines, the FGU is requiring the posting of a performance bond in the amount of $1,000,000.00. The performance bond shall be made out in favor of the Office of the Kalamazoo County Treasurer (acting as the Foreclosing Governmental Unit). Evidence of the issuance and full payment for such bond shall be presented to the FGU within fifteen (15) days of the acceptance of the purchasers bid at auction. In the event evidence of issuance and full payment is not tendered within fifteen (15) days of sale, the sale shall be cancelled outright, and the purchaser considered non-responsive to a necessary condition of the sale. No receipt for the sale shall be issued, and the bidder shall not be entitled to enter upon such premises, until such bond is issued and deemed sufficient by the FGU. Such bond shall be issued by an underwriter licensed to do business in the State of Michigan, who is not the subject of any pending disciplinary action by the State of Michigan or any department, bureau or commission thereof. It shall be payable, in full amount, to the FGU in the event of either whole or partial non-performance of the terms above written for its entire duration. It shall run as effective and be fully pre-paid, for the entire term of twenty-four (24) months. Any overage or refund shall be payable to the purchaser upon earlier termination of the bond because of full performance hereunder. This 24 month time period is not applicable to those performance bonds required for contaminated parcels noted in (5) above. The original of such bond(s) shall be held by an escrow agent satisfactory to the FGU, fully prepaid, at the expense of the purchaser. In the event any purchaser is a corporate or other entity, the principals of such entity must also execute full-recourse personal guarantees that assure payment of the amount(s) due under performance bonds in the event they are not honored for any reason. Compliance with the terms of the requirements hereof shall be at the sole discretion of the FGU. Our inspectors encountered aggressive dogs in the vicinity of this parcel.
