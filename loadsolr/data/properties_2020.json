The foundation of one or more buildings located on this parcel appears to be failing. Correcting foundation issues can be very expensive and issues are often more complex than they initially appear. You should research this issue thoroughly prior to bidding on this parcel. This parcel includes a structure which should be considered DANGEROUS. This building has suffered structural damage which creates substantial risk of harm from falling through damaged areas or collapse from above. It may also contain extensive debris which could fall or collapse, rusty nails, broken glass, and other hazards. You are not permitted to enter this or any other structure offered at tax sale.

Our review of this parcel indicates that the noted State Equalized Value (SEV) does not appear to reflect the current value of the property. This is often due to buildings or other improvements being demolished or fire damaged or other similar items included in the SEV being removed from the property. It can also be due to market changes in the area in which the property is located. It should be further noted that the SEV/assessed value of the parcel as noted in this listing may be several years old.

{"title": "Bundle - Performance Bond Required", "comments": "This is a bundle of parcels being sold as a single lot. You must purchase all included parcels together. Many of these are in the Presque Isle Harbor association, which is a resort and recreation paradise nestled in a bay located not far north of Alpena. In this area, dozens of subdivision plats were laid out in the last half of the 20th century. There are thousands of lots in these subdivisions. It was an overly optimistic venture that anticipated hundreds of vacation and retirement homes. Growth here did not meet the expectations of the original developers, and while the lots sold briskly, construction of homes lagged at a relatively slow pace for much the last 30 years. Many of the roads in the subdivisions have few homes and a good number have none at all. Those closest to the water and amenities are understandably the most populated and improved, and buyers would be well advised to study the aerial maps available on this website to determine those areas in the development that have attracted the most construction. But for those seeking solitude, this development has plenty of that to offer as well. There are numerous pockets in these subdivisions, where you can quite literally have the entire neighborhood to yourself if that is to your liking. The area is served by county-maintained roads, mostly paved, and a private water system that provide water utility to most every lot. There is a strong and ambitious property owner\u2019s association (POA) here, which offers a clubhouse with pool, beach access, a campground and many other assets to members. We have linked to the POA website, where you can find much information relating to both the area and the associations benefits. The website is located at http://presqueisleharbor.org/association.shtml We should note that these lots are not suited to \"flipping\" experiments. The association and water authority are quite serious about collecting their dues and quarterly water fees. Buying lots here is recommended for those who have an intention to keep and use them personally, and not for speculators. As a round figure, you can expect to pay approx. $25,000 per year in association and water dues for the parcels included in this bundle, which typically exceeds the value of the land. One parcel require serious remediation or demolition. Due to this, the county is requiring a performance bond in order to purchase this lot. Purchaser will be required to furnish a personal guarantee and cash surety in the amount of $50,000.00 (the \"Surety\") to ensure the demolition and remediation of the offered property to a safe and debris-free condition. Certified funds in the amount of the Surety shall be deposited with seller or its designee within 5 days of the auction. If the Surety is not presented within 5 days of the auction, the sale shall be canceled for non-performance without refund. Purchaser must present a plan to seller within 60 days of the auction which includes a cost estimate and timeline for the demolition of all structures located on the offered property by a licensed and insured contractor. Such plan must be approved by seller at seller's sole discretion prior to the commencement of demolition and remediation activities. Such demolition and remediation shall be completed within six months of the date of the auction. Demolition shall be considered complete upon certification of seller and at seller's sole discretion. The Surety shall be applied to the costs of demolition and remediation in accordance with the approved plan. Any costs incurred over and above the Surety are the sole responsibility of purchaser. Any Surety which remains after seller certifies the satisfactory completion of all demolition and remediation activities shall be returned to purchaser.

This parcel is located within a municipality which monitors property maintenance and condition. You may be assessed fees and fines if you fail to mow the grass or do not otherwise properly maintain the property after purchase. One advantage to these parcels is that they typically have infrastructure nearby (water, sewer, power). However, you should confirm the availability of such utilities as well as the connection costs prior to bidding. It is your responsibility to determine whether a parcel is suitable for your desired purpose. Our review of this parcel indicates that the noted State Equalized Value (SEV) does not appear to reflect the current value of the property. This is often due to buildings or other improvements being demolished or fire damaged or other similar items included in the SEV being removed from the property. It can also be due to market changes in the area in which the property is located. It should be further noted that the SEV/assessed value of the parcel as noted in this listing may be several years old. You should consult a local real estate professional or appraiser to help you assess the current market value of this property before bidding and should not base your valuation on the stated SEV.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/127928"},

IRS Limited Redemption Right This property is subject to redemption by the Internal Revenue Service through October 27, 2020 due to a lien possessed by the IRS prior to foreclosure. Pursuant to federal law, the Internal Revenue Service is granted an additional 120 days to redeem tax foreclosed property on which they possessed a lien. Normally, this extended redemption right has expired by the time tax foreclosed property is offered for sale. However, due to COVID-19, normal foreclosure timelines have been altered in 2020. As such, the IRS retains a right to redeem this property until October 27, 2020. As a result, the sale of this parcel remains subject to cancellation with a full refund to the buyer if the IRS chooses to exercise its right of redemption. A deed issued following the sale of this property will thus contain the following reverter clause:\u201cThis conveyance is made subject to a right of redemption possessed by the Internal Revenue Service which must be exercised no later than October 27, 2020. In the event that the Internal Revenue Service exercises its right of redemption, title shall automatically revert to Grantor and Grantee shall be awarded a full refund.

Our review of this parcel indicates that the noted State Equalized Value (SEV) does not appear to reflect the current value of the property. This is often due to buildings or other improvements being demolished or fire damaged or other similar items included in the SEV being removed from the property. It can also be due to market changes in the area in which the property is located. It should be further noted that the SEV/assessed value of the parcel as noted in this listing may be several years old. You should consult a local real estate professional or appraiser to help you assess the current market value of this property before bidding and should not base your valuation on the stated SEV. This parcel has surface water, soil, or vegetation conditions indicating that it may include wetland habitat. Such habitat may comprise all or part of the parcel's area. However, it is possible that this parcel contains buildable areas as well.

Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property.

IRS Limited Redemption Right This property is subject to redemption by the Internal Revenue Service through October 27, 2020 due to a lien possessed by the IRS prior to foreclosure. Pursuant to federal law, the Internal Revenue Service is granted an additional 120 days to redeem tax foreclosed property on which they possessed a lien. Normally, this extended redemption right has expired by the time tax foreclosed property is offered for sale. However, due to COVID-19, normal foreclosure timelines have been altered in 2020. As such, the IRS retains a right to redeem this property until October 27, 2020. As a result, the sale of this parcel remains subject to cancellation with a full refund to the buyer if the IRS chooses to exercise its right of redemption. A deed issued following the sale of this property will thus contain the following reverter clause:\u201cThis conveyance is made subject to a right of redemption possessed by the Internal Revenue Service which must be exercised no later than October 27, 2020. In the event that the Internal Revenue Service exercises its right of redemption, title shall automatically revert to Grantor and Grantee shall be awarded a full refund. This possibility of reverter expires after October 27, 2020.\u201d 1200 sf, 3 BR, 1.5 B house in West Neighborhood. Next to a place with good tamales.

This parcel is too small to be practically useful under most circumstances. Many times such parcels are the result of survey or property transfer errors which create small orphaned slivers of land. These parcels are frequently too small to allow construction or any other practical use. They often have no road frontage or legal means of access. These parcels can often lead to adverse claims or encroachments by neighboring land owners which can be complicated legal issues to resolve. Please investigate this parcel thoroughly prior to bidding. This parcel is what we refer to as a 33'/66'. We frequently see foreclosed parcels that are either 33 or 66 feet wide. These parcels are often a result of existing or former road rights of way. A common road right of way is 66 feet wide. Half of that is 33 feet. There are two common scenarios that we see. Scenario 1: A land owner splits a tract of land and creates a common easement parcel for access. They might then quit paying taxes on the parcel with road frontage knowing that the easement would remain even after foreclosure. Such easements are generally either 33 or 66 feet wide. Scenario 2: Rural land generally runs to the center of any public road on which it fronts whereas subdivided land usually runs to the edge of the road right-of-way. Sometimes during surveys or other splits, half of the right-of-way (usually 33 feet) can become orphaned, effectively turning to no-man's-land. Potential bidders should be aware that 33 and 66 foot wide parcels are very likely to include easements. That means that there are people who have a right to use the property even though they do not own the land. It is unlawful to cut off access over a 33 or 66 foot parcel where an easement already exists. Even if an easement doesn't already exists, courts will frequently create such an easement to prevent a neighboring parcel from becoming landlocked. Potential bidders should consider that this parcel likely has little value and cannot be used to landlock a neighboring parcel when there is no other path for ingress and egress.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/128245"},

This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property. Mobile homes (and some modular homes) can be separately titled and considered personal property. In these instances, there may be third parties that have the legal right to remove that mobile home from the parcel whether or not it has been assessed as part of the property in the past. We make no representations or warranties as to whether such mobile or modular homes are included with the real property offered for sale. It is the buyer\u2019s responsibility to conduct their own research as to the state of title. As a preliminary step, it may be useful to determine if an Affidavit of Affixture of Manufactured Home has been executed and recorded as outlined in MCL 125.2330i.

IRS Limited Redemption Right This property is subject to redemption by the Internal Revenue Service through October 27, 2020 due to a lien possessed by the IRS prior to foreclosure. Pursuant to federal law, the Internal Revenue Service is granted an additional 120 days to redeem tax foreclosed property on which they possessed a lien. Normally, this extended redemption right has expired by the time tax foreclosed property is offered for sale. However, due to COVID-19, normal foreclosure timelines have been altered in 2020. As such, the IRS retains a right to redeem this property until October 27, 2020. As a result, the sale of this parcel remains subject to cancellation with a full refund to the buyer if the IRS chooses to exercise its right of redemption. A deed issued following the sale of this property will thus contain the following reverter clause:\u201cThis conveyance is made subject to a right of redemption possessed by the Internal Revenue Service which must be exercised no later than October 27, 2020.

IRS Limited Redemption Right This property is subject to redemption by the Internal Revenue Service through October 27, 2020 due to a lien possessed by the IRS prior to foreclosure. Pursuant to federal law, the Internal Revenue Service is granted an additional 120 days to redeem tax foreclosed property on which they possessed a lien. Normally, this extended redemption right has expired by the time tax foreclosed property is offered for sale. However, due to COVID-19, normal foreclosure timelines have been altered in 2020. As such, the IRS retains a right to redeem this property until October 27, 2020. As a result, the sale of this parcel remains subject to cancellation with a full refund to the buyer if the IRS chooses to exercise its right of redemption. A deed issued following the sale of this property will thus contain the following reverter clause:\u201cThis conveyance is made subject to a right of redemption possessed by the Internal Revenue Service which must be exercised no later than October 27, 2020. In the event that the Internal Revenue Service exercises its right of redemption, title shall automatically revert to Grantor and Grantee shall be awarded a full refund.

Our review of this parcel indicates that the noted State Equalized Value (SEV) does not appear to reflect the current value of the property. This is often due to buildings or other improvements being demolished or fire damaged or other similar items included in the SEV being removed from the property. It can also be due to market changes in the area in which the property is located. It should be further noted that the SEV/assessed value of the parcel as noted in this listing may be several years old. You should consult a local real estate professional or appraiser to help you assess the current market value of this property before bidding and should not base your valuation on the stated SEV. This parcel is located within a municipality which monitors property maintenance and condition. You may be assessed fees and fines if you fail to mow the grass or do not otherwise properly maintain the property after purchase. One advantage to these parcels is that they typically have infrastructure nearby (water, sewer, power). However, you should confirm the availability of such utilities as well as the connection costs prior to bidding.

This parcel has surface water, soil, or vegetation conditions indicating that it may include wetland habitat. Such habitat may comprise all or part of the parcel's area. However, it is possible that this parcel contains buildable areas as well. There are many environmental and building regulations related to wetlands which you should consult before bidding on this parcel. It is your responsibility to determine if this parcel is suitable for your desired use. This parcel is what we refer to as a 33'/66'. We frequently see foreclosed parcels that are either 33 or 66 feet wide. These parcels are often a result of existing or former road rights of way. A common road right of way is 66 feet wide. Half of that is 33 feet. There are two common scenarios that we see. Scenario 1: A land owner splits a tract of land and creates a common easement parcel for access. They might then quit paying taxes on the parcel with road frontage knowing that the easement would remain even after foreclosure. Such easements are generally either 33 or 66 feet wide. Scenario 2: Rural land generally runs to the center of any public road on which it fronts whereas subdivided land usually runs to the edge of the road right-of-way. Sometimes during surveys or other splits, half of the right-of-way (usually 33 feet) can become orphaned, effectively turning to no-man's-land. Potential bidders should be aware that 33 and 66 foot wide parcels are very likely to include easements. That means that there are people who have a right to use the property even though they do not own the land. It is unlawful to cut off access over a 33 or 66 foot parcel where an easement already exists. Even if an easement doesn't already exists, courts will frequently create such an easement to prevent a neighboring parcel from becoming landlocked. Potential bidders should consider that this parcel likely has little value and cannot be used to landlock a neighboring parcel when there is no other path for ingress and egress.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/127933"},

A purchaser may encounter future contact from this lender. Tax foreclosure supersedes the rights of mortgage holders. If a mortgage holder does not foreclose upon their mortgage interest prior to tax foreclosure, their right to do so is generally lost. Typically such mortgage holders were provided all necessary notice of tax foreclosure but failed to act in a timely fashion to preserve their interest.

You are not eligible to purchase this property for the lower \"no reserve\" amount offered at this second round sale. The minimum bid includes all delinquent taxes, interest, penalties, and fees that were due on the property at the time of foreclosure. See MCL 211.78m(5) for more information. One or more structures was boarded when we conducted our assessment of this parcel. Properties may be boarded for a variety of reasons. For example, properties are often boarded to prevent trespassers from harvesting copper plumbing, wiring, and other fixtures. Buildings may also be boarded by fire or other officials when they present a safety hazard. We generally do not enter boarded structures and limit our observations to the building's exterior. Likewise, you should limit any inspection of this property to its exterior only. You are not permitted to remove any boarding to view building interiors under any circumstances. Public property records or polite inquiries to neighbors may reveal additional information about a property's history. The interior of this property was not viewed during our inspection. Buildings which are dangerous, occupied, boarded, condemned, or otherwise difficult to enter are inspected from the exterior/curbside only. You are NOT authorized to enter these or any other buildings offered for sale. You should limit your inspection to that which can be made safely from the building's exterior. This parcel includes a structure which should be considered DANGEROUS. This building has suffered structural damage which creates substantial risk of harm from falling through damaged areas or collapse from above. It may also contain extensive debris which could fall or collapse, rusty nails, broken glass, and other hazards. You are not permitted to enter this or any other structure offered at tax sale. You should limit your inspection only to what can be safely observed from the building's exterior. Trespassers are subject to prosecution.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/128676"},

This parcel is located within a municipality which monitors property maintenance and condition. You may be assessed fees and fines if you fail to mow the grass or do not otherwise properly maintain the property after purchase. One advantage to these parcels is that they typically have infrastructure nearby (water, sewer, power). However, you should confirm the availability of such utilities as well as the connection costs prior to bidding. It is your responsibility to determine whether a parcel is suitable for your desired purpose. Very large wood frame home in Crystal Falls. Note that we have a vacant lot next door also available (sale 4038) in case you'd like a larger yard. This is a pretty large place that includes a two story Biltmore addition. The rear portion is on a Michigan cellar, the forward section we *think* is on a crawlspace. All of the foundation seems solid. The condition of this building is difficult to assess because it is loaded with old clothing, food garbage and other accumulation. You'll need to get it empties out to get a good grasp of its real condition. However our walkthrough seemed to indicate that it has \"good bones\" and is worthy of rehabilitation. The roof is *ancient* and is leaking in a couple of specific spots upstairs. So far it has not caused significant damage, but it will if left unchecked. The hot water heat boiler is disassembled, indicating some issues there. Newer 100A electric service. The biggest issue with this property is the mess. Clean it out, add a fresh roof and some resurfacing, and this is not a bad house.

Mobile homes (and some modular homes) can be separately titled and considered personal property. In these instances, there may be third parties that have the legal right to remove that mobile home from the parcel whether or not it has been assessed as part of the property in the past. We make no representations or warranties as to whether such mobile or modular homes are included with the real property offered for sale. It is the buyer\u2019s responsibility to conduct their own research as to the state of title. As a preliminary step, it may be useful to determine if an Affidavit of Affixture of Manufactured Home has been executed and recorded as outlined in MCL 125.2330i. You may wish to consult a licensed attorney or title company to assist in this research. This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property. This parcel includes a structure which should be considered DANGEROUS. This building has suffered structural damage which creates substantial risk of harm from falling through damaged areas or collapse from above. It may also contain extensive debris which could fall or collapse, rusty nails, broken glass, and other hazards. You are not permitted to enter this or any other structure offered at tax sale. You should limit your inspection only to what can be safely observed from the building's exterior. Trespassers are subject to prosecution. This parcel has been posted as \"Condemned\" by the local building authority. Properties are generally condemned when they are deemed substandard, unsafe, or otherwise unfit for use and habitation. Condemned property must be rehabilitated to meet local building codes prior to use or occupancy. A building is not automatically slated for demolition when condemned. However, this does not necessarily mean that demolition will not also be pursued by the local unit. Please check with the local building official before bidding to determine the specific status and requirements for this property.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/127776"},

This lot is part of a condominium development. A condominium is a form of land ownership which is divided up into individual \"units.\" Owners are required to be part of the applicable condominium association (COA) which includes rules and regulations related to the use and ownership of each unit. Additional restrictions will be spelled out in the development's master deed. Condominiums also include association fees which can be significant. Some condominium units delegate things like exterior maintenance and repair to the COA whereas the owner remains responsible for the unit's interior. However, there are many varieties of condominiums including residential and commercial interior space, condo subdivision lots, condo boat slips, condo campsites and others. Prospective bidders should carefully review and understand the master deed, COA rules and regulations, and investigate association fees prior to bidding. This parcel is likely subject to ASSOCIATION FEES which are assessed to cover maintenance and other costs associated with the development in which the parcel is located. Interested parties should verify the existence and extent of association fees and costs prior to bidding.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/127773"},

This property appears as if it may be a side-yard parcel. Frequently homes are located on one parcel and the associated back or side-yard is located on a separate adjacent parcel. These side-yards are sometimes foreclosed while the home is not. This can create unfortunate situations where fenced boundaries, septic tanks, out buildings, garages, and other improvements that were previously associated with the home next door are sold on their own. Such parcels may have value to the adjacent owners but often have little to no value on their own.

IRS Limited Redemption Right This property is subject to redemption by the Internal Revenue Service through October 27, 2020 due to a lien possessed by the IRS prior to foreclosure. Pursuant to federal law, the Internal Revenue Service is granted an additional 120 days to redeem tax foreclosed property on which they possessed a lien. Normally, this extended redemption right has expired by the time tax foreclosed property is offered for sale. However, due to COVID-19, normal foreclosure timelines have been altered in 2020. As such, the IRS retains a right to redeem this property until October 27, 2020. As a result, the sale of this parcel remains subject to cancellation with a full refund to the buyer if the IRS chooses to exercise its right of redemption. A deed issued following the sale of this property will thus contain the following reverter clause:\u201cThis conveyance is made subject to a right of redemption possessed by the Internal Revenue Service which must be exercised no later than October 27, 2020. In the event that the Internal Revenue Service exercises its right of redemption, title shall automatically revert to Grantor and Grantee shall be awarded a full refund. This possibility of reverter expires after October 27, 2020.\u201d", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/128653"},

The basement is cavernoous, and has high ceilings and much space that could be repurposed. The second floor has been stripped of most of its lath and plaster (a really dirty job) and that has been hauled away. With proper engineeering of load bearing support, you could make this into a spectacular loft style flat. There is *not* an interior stairway from the upper level down, and at present it relies on a really questionable exterior stair and balcony/porch that is in the process of failing. We have marked it with caution tape, and you'd be well advised to just review our photos and not make that trip yourself. The roof on this building is older, but other than the garage, it is not leaking at present. Foundation looks solid, it has a modern hi-efficiency furnace, and a 200A electric main.

IRS Limited Redemption Right This property is subject to redemption by the Internal Revenue Service through November 17, 2020 due to a lien possessed by the IRS prior to foreclosure. Pursuant to federal law, the Internal Revenue Service is granted an additional 120 days to redeem tax foreclosed property on which they possessed a lien. Normally, this extended redemption right has expired by the time tax foreclosed property is offered for sale. However, due to COVID-19, normal foreclosure timelines have been altered in 2020. As such, the IRS retains a right to redeem this property until November 17, 2020. As a result, the sale of this parcel remains subject to cancellation with a full refund to the buyer if the IRS chooses to exercise its right of redemption.

However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property.

IRS Limited Redemption Right This property is subject to redemption by the Internal Revenue Service through October 27, 2020 due to a lien possessed by the IRS prior to foreclosure. Pursuant to federal law, the Internal Revenue Service is granted an additional 120 days to redeem tax foreclosed property on which they possessed a lien. Normally, this extended redemption right has expired by the time tax foreclosed property is offered for sale. However, due to COVID-19, normal foreclosure timelines have been altered in 2020. As such, the IRS retains a right to redeem this property until October 27, 2020. As a result, the sale of this parcel remains subject to cancellation with a full refund to the buyer if the IRS chooses to exercise its right of redemption. A deed issued following the sale of this property will thus contain the following reverter clause:\u201cThis conveyance is made subject to a right of redemption possessed by the Internal Revenue Service which must be exercised no later than October 27, 2020.

Issues surrounding unimproved roads can be complicated and expensive to resolve. You should investigate the existence of any roads and the ability to access this parcel thoroughly before bidding.

Often times there are easements in the recorded chain-of-title that provide legal access to such parcels but other times there are not.

The walls are made of screens so you can see all 360 degrees. Reminiscent to a camp ground. There is power running to each of the buildings. The breaker box is in the center of the property and has names for all of the buildings. The property looks to have been abandoned for some time. There is debris in most of the buildings. This is a large property that would be great for hunting. Maybe turn the buildings into some hunting shacks? This property is mostly wooded except for a small clearing next to the small \"town\" of buildings. This property has a ton of potential. We are also offering Lot 9843 which is directly below this property and is ~80 as well. If you purchase both properties you could have ~160 acres of hunting land!

This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property.

It may also contain extensive debris which could fall or collapse, rusty nails, broken glass, and other hazards. You are not permitted to enter this or any other structure offered at tax sale. You should limit your inspection only to what can be safely observed from the building's exterior. Trespassers are subject to prosecution. IRS Limited Redemption Right This property is subject to redemption by the Internal Revenue Service through October 27, 2020 due to a lien possessed by the IRS prior to foreclosure. Pursuant to federal law, the Internal Revenue Service is granted an additional 120 days to redeem tax foreclosed property on which they possessed a lien. Normally, this extended redemption right has expired by the time tax foreclosed property is offered for sale. However, due to COVID-19, normal foreclosure timelines have been altered in 2020. As such, the IRS retains a right to redeem this property until October 27, 2020. As a result, the sale of this parcel remains subject to cancellation with a full refund to the buyer if the IRS chooses to exercise its right of redemption. A deed issued following the sale of this property will thus contain the following reverter clause:\u201cThis conveyance is made subject to a right of redemption possessed by the Internal Revenue Service which must be exercised no later than October 27, 2020. In the event that the Internal Revenue Service exercises its right of redemption, title shall automatically revert to Grantor and Grantee shall be awarded a full refund. This possibility of reverter expires after October 27, 2020.\u201d One or more buildings on this parcel has a roof which is either leaking to the interior or appears close to failure.

{"title": "Waterfront Condo Lot On Oakpointe", "comments": "Waterfront condo lot on Oakpointe This parcel is likely subject to ASSOCIATION FEES which are assessed to cover maintenance and other costs associated with the development in which the parcel is located. Interested parties should verify the existence and extent of association fees and costs prior to bidding. This property is subject to redemption by the Internal Revenue Service until the last day of July of this year. The IRS held liens against this property for unpaid income or other taxes for which they have been duly notified. Under applicable Treasury Regulations, the IRS has an additional 120 days after the normal deadline of March 31 to pay outstanding taxes and redeem the property. If the auction date for this property is prior to July 31, your purchase will be subject to the redemption rights of the IRS. If the IRS exercises such rights, you will be issued a full refund of the purchase price as reflected on your official auction receipt. If the auction date is AFTER July 31, any IRS liens and redemption rights will be extinguished. This parcel is an unbuilt unit in a condominium project. These units are sometimes referred to as \"air condos\". Such units may be located on the second or third floor of an unbuilt development. In such a case, you are effectively buying \"air\" and not any tangible structure or property. It may be possible to develop this unit after purchase. However, condo developments are subject to the requirements and restrictions laid out in the master deed for those developments. Any interested bidder should obtain a copy of the master deed for this project and fully understand the requirements and restrictions contained therein before bidding. Purchasers may also be subject to condominium association fees starting from the date of purchase. There may be some value here for an experienced developer but these units are generally not a wise purchase for a novice. Please do your research. IRS Limited Redemption Right This property is subject to redemption by the Internal Revenue Service through October 27, 2020 due to a lien possessed by the IRS prior to foreclosure. Pursuant to federal law, the Internal Revenue Service is granted an additional 120 days to redeem tax foreclosed property on which they possessed a lien. Normally, this extended redemption right has expired by the time tax foreclosed property is offered for sale. However, due to COVID-19, normal foreclosure timelines have been altered in 2020. As such, the IRS retains a right to redeem this property until October 27, 2020. As a result, the sale of this parcel remains subject to cancellation with a full refund to the buyer if the IRS chooses to exercise its right of redemption. A deed issued following the sale of this property will thus contain the following reverter clause:\u201cThis conveyance is made subject to a right of redemption possessed by the Internal Revenue Service which must be exercised no later than October 27, 2020. In the event that the Internal Revenue Service exercises its right of redemption, title shall automatically revert to Grantor and Grantee shall be awarded a full refund. This possibility of reverter expires after October 27, 2020.\u201d", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/122579"},

However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property.

{"title": "Vacant Land On Park", "comments": "This parcel has surface water, soil, or vegetation conditions indicating that it may include wetland habitat. Such habitat may comprise all or part of the parcel's area. However, it is possible that this parcel contains buildable areas as well. There are many environmental and building regulations related to wetlands which you should consult before bidding on this parcel. It is your responsibility to determine if this parcel is suitable for your desired use. This parcel is what we refer to as a 33'/66'. We frequently see foreclosed parcels that are either 33 or 66 feet wide. These parcels are often a result of existing or former road rights of way. A common road right of way is 66 feet wide. Half of that is 33 feet. There are two common scenarios that we see. Scenario 1: A land owner splits a tract of land and creates a common easement parcel for access. They might then quit paying taxes on the parcel with road frontage knowing that the easement would remain even after foreclosure. Such easements are generally either 33 or 66 feet wide. Scenario 2: Rural land generally runs to the center of any public road on which it fronts whereas subdivided land usually runs to the edge of the road right-of-way. Sometimes during surveys or other splits, half of the right-of-way (usually 33 feet) can become orphaned, effectively turning to no-man's-land. Potential bidders should be aware that 33 and 66 foot wide parcels are very likely to include easements. That means that there are people who have a right to use the property even though they do not own the land. It is unlawful to cut off access over a 33 or 66 foot parcel where an easement already exists. Even if an easement doesn't already exists, courts will frequently create such an easement to prevent a neighboring parcel from becoming landlocked. Potential bidders should consider that this parcel likely has little value and cannot be used to landlock a neighboring parcel when there is no other path for ingress and egress.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/122512"},

IRS Limited Redemption Right This property is subject to redemption by the Internal Revenue Service through November 17, 2020 due to a lien possessed by the IRS prior to foreclosure. Pursuant to federal law, the Internal Revenue Service is granted an additional 120 days to redeem tax foreclosed property on which they possessed a lien. Normally, this extended redemption right has expired by the time tax foreclosed property is offered for sale. However, due to COVID-19, normal foreclosure timelines have been altered in 2020. As such, the IRS retains a right to redeem this property until November 17, 2020. As a result, the sale of this parcel remains subject to cancellation with a full refund to the buyer if the IRS chooses to exercise its right of redemption. A deed issued following the sale of this property will thus contain the following reverter clause: \u201cThis conveyance is made subject to a right of redemption possessed by the Internal Revenue Service which must be exercised no later than November 17, 2020. In the event that the Internal Revenue Service exercises its right of redemption, title shall automatically revert to Grantor and Grantee shall be awarded a full refund.

IRS Limited Redemption Right This property is subject to redemption by the Internal Revenue Service through November 17, 2020 due to a lien possessed by the IRS prior to foreclosure. Pursuant to federal law, the Internal Revenue Service is granted an additional 120 days to redeem tax foreclosed property on which they possessed a lien. Normally, this extended redemption right has expired by the time tax foreclosed property is offered for sale. However, due to COVID-19, normal foreclosure timelines have been altered in 2020. As such, the IRS retains a right to redeem this property until November 17, 2020. As a result, the sale of this parcel remains subject to cancellation with a full refund to the buyer if the IRS chooses to exercise its right of redemption. A deed issued following the sale of this property will thus contain the following reverter clause: \u201cThis conveyance is made subject to a right of redemption possessed by the Internal Revenue Service which must be exercised no later than November 17, 2020. In the event that the Internal Revenue Service exercises its right of redemption, title shall automatically revert to Grantor and Grantee shall be awarded a full refund. This possibility of reverter expires after November 17, 2020.\u201d", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/120818"},

Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property. This property is occupied. Please respect the privacy of current occupants and limit any inspection to what can be safely observed from the road. Some occupants may be upset or angry and may meet contact with aggression or violence. Please use discretion and caution when researching this or other occupied properties. Furthermore, although this property has been foreclosed for unpaid taxes, occupants have certain rights under Michigan law and must be formally evicted if unwilling to leave voluntarily. You may wish to consult a licensed attorney for more information. This building contains evidence of mold. Mold is an indication of excess moisture which can come from a variety of sources including high ground water, improper sealing of foundation walls, damaged roofs, and other conditions which can be expensive to correct. Mold can pose significant health risks and, if extensive, may require a complete renovation which could exceed the value of the building. Please conduct your own research and bid accordingly. The building on this property appears to have been used for multi-family occupancy in the past based upon indicators such as multiple mailboxes, entrances, numbering, layout, or other such factors. Modifications to the property may NOT have been legally made and may NOT conform to local zoning. Prospective bidders should verify with local officials that multi-family use is permitted under existing zoning. In many areas, once a multi-family use has been discontinued, it cannot be reinstated unless in conformance with local zoning and code. IRS Limited Redemption Right This property is subject to redemption by the Internal Revenue Service through October 27, 2020 due to a lien possessed by the IRS prior to foreclosure. Pursuant to federal law, the Internal Revenue Service is granted an additional 120 days to redeem tax foreclosed property on which they possessed a lien. Normally, this extended redemption right has expired by the time tax foreclosed property is offered for sale. However, due to COVID-19, normal foreclosure timelines have been altered in 2020. As such, the IRS retains a right to redeem this property until October 27, 2020. As a result, the sale of this parcel remains subject to cancellation with a full refund to the buyer if the IRS chooses to exercise its right of redemption. A deed issued following the sale of this property will thus contain the following reverter clause:\u201cThis conveyance is made subject to a right of redemption possessed by the Internal Revenue Service which must be exercised no later than October 27, 2020. In the event that the Internal Revenue Service exercises its right of redemption, title shall automatically revert to Grantor and Grantee shall be awarded a full refund. This possibility of reverter expires after October 27, 2020.\u201d", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/123162"},

There is serious roof issues which has caused major water damage. The main floor ceiling has fallen through and there is black mold starting to form on some of the walls. The second floor apartment is accessible by an exterior staircase. The stair case was unstable so we did not attempt to enter the second floor. Due to roof issues i imagine the second floor has major water damage as well. This building will need major repairs. The building on this property appears to have been used for multi-family occupancy in the past based upon indicators such as multiple mailboxes, entrances, numbering, layout, or other such factors. Modifications to the property may NOT have been legally made and may NOT conform to local zoning. Prospective bidders should verify with local officials that multi-family use is permitted under existing zoning. In many areas, once a multi-family use has been discontinued, it cannot be reinstated unless in conformance with local zoning and code. One or more buildings on this parcel has a roof which is either leaking to the interior or appears close to failure. Failing roofs often indicate substantial structural decay inside the building.

{"title": "1+ Acre With House And Garage. Big Star Lake Area.", "comments": "Mid century frame housing (older mobile that has been morphed into a house) with large steel extra deep garage perfect for boat storage, PLUS a smaller wood frame two car garage that needs some work. There is trash strewn around the property, but a few dumpsters and you're back in business! We did not enter the main structure because of extensive food garbage issues and general sanitation issues. Is was secured at the time of our visit and was stinky and messy but appeared intact otherwise. This is a \"cold weather\" cleanup project. Don't be afraid of this one, but its going to be a job for someone that doesn't mind dirty work. Neighbor mentions that the last occupant had dozens of cats (explains the smell) and that the plumbing and well froze from a lack of heat. Parcel is 1.2 acre more or less and fronts on Shady Grove to the front and Grover to the rear. The newer steel garage to the rear isn't horribly old. Has a sand floor but could easily be finished off into a much nicer condition. Power service here has been dropped. Meter gone. It appears that the last regular occupancy here has been a few years. We saw a 1986 calendar in the garage on the wall .... hold your nose and enter your bid! This property contains physical indications that one or more water lines have frozen, ruptured, and leaked for a significant period of time prior to being shut off. Such indications can include damage to ceilings and floors and visibly damaged pipes and fixtures. Damage from freeze bursts can be substantial including significant harm to structural components such as framing and foundations. Pet and/or wild animal waste was observed within this property. Potential bidders should consider that urine stains/odors can be difficult to remove from porous surfaces such as wood floors or underlayment. This property is unsanitary and poses a potential health hazard because of raw food garbage, backed up sewer lines, or other similar waste. Such conditions can attract rodents, wild animals, and other vermin. You should bid accordingly and be prepared to mitigate the situation immediately upon purchase.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/123583"},

{"title": "A Heap Of A Mess. Cecilia Lake Area", "comments": "Tore up mobile home on a trash strewn lot near Cecilia Lake (Star Lakes area). There is also a two car garage here that is merchantable and likely a well and septic worth reuse. Clean it up and it could be a decent parcel! Single-wide on property is missing the skirting, and the front portion of the steel roof has blown (or was torn) off, exposing the interior to the elements for a while. Likely way beyond salvage. Garage and property contains a half dozen cars/trucks, engines, body parts and other manstuff. It's all garbage. LARGE PARCEL is 12 lots in the Chain O Lakes plat. This parcel includes a structure which should be considered DANGEROUS. This building has suffered structural damage which creates substantial risk of harm from falling through damaged areas or collapse from above. It may also contain extensive debris which could fall or collapse, rusty nails, broken glass, and other hazards. You are not permitted to enter this or any other structure offered at tax sale. You should limit your inspection only to what can be safely observed from the building's exterior. Trespassers are subject to prosecution. Mobile homes (and some modular homes) can be separately titled and considered personal property. In these instances, there may be third parties that have the legal right to remove that mobile home from the parcel whether or not it has been assessed as part of the property in the past. We make no representations or warranties as to whether such mobile or modular homes are included with the real property offered for sale. It is the buyer\u2019s responsibility to conduct their own research as to the state of title. As a preliminary step, it may be useful to determine if an Affidavit of Affixture of Manufactured Home has been executed and recorded as outlined in MCL 125.2330i. You may wish to consult a licensed attorney or title company to assist in this research.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/123580"},

They are in better condition than the main structure, and you could entertain the whole fam damily here, or several friends could go in together and share it. Please verify the lot boundaries before bidding, but we believe there are three units here total. Appears to be a shared well located in front of the two units on Sunrise. The interior of this property was not viewed during our inspection. Buildings which are dangerous, occupied, boarded, condemned, or otherwise difficult to enter are inspected from the exterior/curbside only. You are NOT authorized to enter these or any other buildings offered for sale. You should limit your inspection to that which can be made safely from the building's exterior.

The house is difficult to see from the road, but if you follow the curving driveway in to the parcel, you'll find it. The structure is a modular home, and the exterior has not had maintenance in some time. The yard is very overgrown, and the soffits and fascia of the roof are detached or loose in many areas. There are broken and open windows and doors, and garbage is strewn widely through the yard. There are several vehicles, boats and other items around the yard. But the real treat is the interior. This is perhaps one of the grubbiest homes that we have encountered in recent years. There is decay and filth from one end to the other, and during our July visit it was \"ripe\" to the degree that we did not spend much time indoors. The floors are covered with a dark material that may be decayed feces or it may be dirt. Our guess is the first of the two. There is also decayed food garbage, and the doors have been open long enough for several critters to have taken up residence ... we could hear them moving around. Structurally the building seems sound, but this one will take considerable work to bring back to habitability. We suspect it will need to be stripped right to the studs and joists to eliminate the degree of grunge that permeates it. This is not a paint and flip house by any means. We saw metal items inside the home that were heavily oxidized, indicating that the doors and windows that are open here have been open for a considerable amount of time. There is also clear evidence of animal damage ... could have been dogs ... also just as likely to have been raccoons or similar critters. This is not for the faint of heart, but could be a decent place with a LOT of elbow grease. This property is unsanitary and poses a potential health hazard because of raw food garbage, backed up sewer lines, or other similar waste.

IRS Limited Redemption Right This property is subject to redemption by the Internal Revenue Service through November 17, 2020 due to a lien possessed by the IRS prior to foreclosure. Pursuant to federal law, the Internal Revenue Service is granted an additional 120 days to redeem tax foreclosed property on which they possessed a lien. Normally, this extended redemption right has expired by the time tax foreclosed property is offered for sale. However, due to COVID-19, normal foreclosure timelines have been altered in 2020. As such, the IRS retains a right to redeem this property until November 17, 2020. As a result, the sale of this parcel remains subject to cancellation with a full refund to the buyer if the IRS chooses to exercise its right of redemption. A deed issued following the sale of this property will thus contain the following reverter clause: \u201cThis conveyance is made subject to a right of redemption possessed by the Internal Revenue Service which must be exercised no later than November 17, 2020. In the event that the Internal Revenue Service exercises its right of redemption, title shall automatically revert to Grantor and Grantee shall be awarded a full refund.

You may be assessed fees and fines if you fail to mow the grass or do not otherwise properly maintain the property after purchase. One advantage to these parcels is that they typically have infrastructure nearby (water, sewer, power). However, you should confirm the availability of such utilities as well as the connection costs prior to bidding. It is your responsibility to determine whether a parcel is suitable for your desired purpose. This parcel is too small to be practically useful under most circumstances. Many times such parcels are the result of survey or property transfer errors which create small orphaned slivers of land. These parcels are frequently too small to allow construction or any other practical use. They often have no road frontage or legal means of access. These parcels can often lead to adverse claims or encroachments by neighboring land owners which can be complicated legal issues to resolve. Please investigate this parcel thoroughly prior to bidding. This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address.

IRS Limited Redemption Right This property is subject to redemption by the Internal Revenue Service through November 17, 2020 due to a lien possessed by the IRS prior to foreclosure. Pursuant to federal law, the Internal Revenue Service is granted an additional 120 days to redeem tax foreclosed property on which they possessed a lien. Normally, this extended redemption right has expired by the time tax foreclosed property is offered for sale. However, due to COVID-19, normal foreclosure timelines have been altered in 2020. As such, the IRS retains a right to redeem this property until November 17, 2020. As a result, the sale of this parcel remains subject to cancellation with a full refund to the buyer if the IRS chooses to exercise its right of redemption. A deed issued following the sale of this property will thus contain the following reverter clause: \u201cThis conveyance is made subject to a right of redemption possessed by the Internal Revenue Service which must be exercised no later than November 17, 2020. In the event that the Internal Revenue Service exercises its right of redemption, title shall automatically revert to Grantor and Grantee shall be awarded a full refund.

{"title": "Small Parcel Near White Tail Lodge. ", "comments": "Itsy-bitsy, teeny-tiny, 33 foot wide strip of land that runs both south and east from the SE corner of the intersection of S 13 Mile and E Kelly Road in Butterfield. Not of much use to anyone except adjacent property owners. Note: Parcel boundaries shown on map image are approximate and for reference purposes only. This parcel is too small to be practically useful under most circumstances. Many times such parcels are the result of survey or property transfer errors which create small orphaned slivers of land. These parcels are frequently too small to allow construction or any other practical use. They often have no road frontage or legal means of access. These parcels can often lead to adverse claims or encroachments by neighboring land owners which can be complicated legal issues to resolve. Please investigate this parcel thoroughly prior to bidding. This parcel is what we refer to as a 33'/66'. We frequently see foreclosed parcels that are either 33 or 66 feet wide. These parcels are often a result of existing or former road rights of way. A common road right of way is 66 feet wide. Half of that is 33 feet. There are two common scenarios that we see. Scenario 1: A land owner splits a tract of land and creates a common easement parcel for access. They might then quit paying taxes on the parcel with road frontage knowing that the easement would remain even after foreclosure. Such easements are generally either 33 or 66 feet wide. Scenario 2: Rural land generally runs to the center of any public road on which it fronts whereas subdivided land usually runs to the edge of the road right-of-way. Sometimes during surveys or other splits, half of the right-of-way (usually 33 feet) can become orphaned, effectively turning to no-man's-land. Potential bidders should be aware that 33 and 66 foot wide parcels are very likely to include easements. That means that there are people who have a right to use the property even though they do not own the land. It is unlawful to cut off access over a 33 or 66 foot parcel where an easement already exists. Even if an easement doesn't already exists, courts will frequently create such an easement to prevent a neighboring parcel from becoming landlocked. Potential bidders should consider that this parcel likely has little value and cannot be used to landlock a neighboring parcel when there is no other path for ingress and egress.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/124324"},

Overgrown vegetation is starting take over the sides of the home. This house will no doubt need some work but there's a lot of potential here. Great fixer upper project. This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/127661"},

SEV does not appear to have been updated since then. May be inaccurate. Open grassy lot with a driveway entrance at the road. Across the street from a church. This parcel is located within a municipality which monitors property maintenance and condition. You may be assessed fees and fines if you fail to mow the grass or do not otherwise properly maintain the property after purchase. One advantage to these parcels is that they typically have infrastructure nearby (water, sewer, power). However, you should confirm the availability of such utilities as well as the connection costs prior to bidding. It is your responsibility to determine whether a parcel is suitable for your desired purpose. Our review of this parcel indicates that the noted State Equalized Value (SEV) does not appear to reflect the current value of the property. This is often due to buildings or other improvements being demolished or fire damaged or other similar items included in the SEV being removed from the property. It can also be due to market changes in the area in which the property is located. It should be further noted that the SEV/assessed value of the parcel as noted in this listing may be several years old. You should consult a local real estate professional or appraiser to help you assess the current market value of this property before bidding and should not base your valuation on the stated SEV.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/127650"},

Overgrown grass is all over the clearing. The rest of the property is forested. The house looks to be in overall poor shape. The Roof is sagging and the shingles are peeling which leads me to believe there is some leaking present in the home. Metal siding needs as paint job. There is some debris scatter about the property. Block foundation looks solid no major damage seen. Electric meter still present. The house will no doubt need work but this could be a good opportunity for a renovator to start their next project. The acreage alone is worth a bid.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/127488"},

The front yard is very spacious and open with a few large trees offering shade. Some of the windows and the attached garage door has been boarded shut. There were a handful of old sheds in the back yard. As you Enter the property further into the North section it is forested. There is debris in the home and in the back yard. The neighbors said that the house is unlivable at the moment and that it was condemned. However no condemned notices were posted. The house will no doubt need some work but the land alone is worth trying to win this property. This parcel has been posted as \"Condemned\" by the local building authority. Properties are generally condemned when they are deemed substandard, unsafe, or otherwise unfit for use and habitation. Condemned property must be rehabilitated to meet local building codes prior to use or occupancy. A building is not automatically slated for demolition when condemned. However, this does not necessarily mean that demolition will not also be pursued by the local unit. Please check with the local building official before bidding to determine the specific status and requirements for this property. One or more structures was boarded when we conducted our assessment of this parcel. Properties may be boarded for a variety of reasons. For example, properties are often boarded to prevent trespassers from harvesting copper plumbing, wiring, and other fixtures. Buildings may also be boarded by fire or other officials when they present a safety hazard. We generally do not enter boarded structures and limit our observations to the building's exterior. Likewise, you should limit any inspection of this property to its exterior only. You are not permitted to remove any boarding to view building interiors under any circumstances. Public property records or polite inquiries to neighbors may reveal additional information about a property's history.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/127482"},

Pursuant to federal law, the Internal Revenue Service is granted an additional 120 days to redeem tax foreclosed property on which they possessed a lien. Normally, this extended redemption right has expired by the time tax foreclosed property is offered for sale. However, due to COVID-19, normal foreclosure timelines have been altered in 2020. As such, the IRS retains a right to redeem this property until October 27, 2020. As a result, the sale of this parcel remains subject to cancellation with a full refund to the buyer if the IRS chooses to exercise its right of redemption. A deed issued following the sale of this property will thus contain the following reverter clause:\u201cThis conveyance is made subject to a right of redemption possessed by the Internal Revenue Service which must be exercised no later than October 27, 2020. In the event that the Internal Revenue Service exercises its right of redemption, title shall automatically revert to Grantor and Grantee shall be awarded a full refund.

There are many environmental and building regulations related to wetlands which you should consult before bidding on this parcel. It is your responsibility to determine if this parcel is suitable for your desired use. IRS Limited Redemption Right This property is subject to redemption by the Internal Revenue Service through October 27, 2020 due to a lien possessed by the IRS prior to foreclosure. Pursuant to federal law, the Internal Revenue Service is granted an additional 120 days to redeem tax foreclosed property on which they possessed a lien. Normally, this extended redemption right has expired by the time tax foreclosed property is offered for sale. However, due to COVID-19, normal foreclosure timelines have been altered in 2020. As such, the IRS retains a right to redeem this property until October 27, 2020. As a result, the sale of this parcel remains subject to cancellation with a full refund to the buyer if the IRS chooses to exercise its right of redemption. A deed issued following the sale of this property will thus contain the following reverter clause:\u201cThis conveyance is made subject to a right of redemption possessed by the Internal Revenue Service which must be exercised no later than October 27, 2020. In the event that the Internal Revenue Service exercises its right of redemption, title shall automatically revert to Grantor and Grantee shall be awarded a full refund. This possibility of reverter expires after October 27, 2020.\u201d", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/124668"},

A condominium \"unit\" is a form of land ownership which is similar to a traditional subdivision \"lot\" but is also different in some important respects. Each condominium development is laid out in a document called the master deed which outlines the extent and nature of each condominium unit. The master deed also contains rules and restrictions related to construction and permitted use. Construction requirements can include everything from the size or design of buildings to color and orientation on the site. Condominium developments also include \"common elements\" like streets and sidewalks which are shared across all units. Some developments include amenities like golf courses, clubhouses, beaches, pools, and parks whereas others include only basic infrastructure like roads and sidewalks. Site condominiums also include association fees which can be significant. Prospective bidders should carefully review and understand the master deed and investigate association fees prior to bidding.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/119972"},

IRS Limited Redemption Right This property is subject to redemption by the Internal Revenue Service through October 27, 2020 due to a lien possessed by the IRS prior to foreclosure. Pursuant to federal law, the Internal Revenue Service is granted an additional 120 days to redeem tax foreclosed property on which they possessed a lien. Normally, this extended redemption right has expired by the time tax foreclosed property is offered for sale. However, due to COVID-19, normal foreclosure timelines have been altered in 2020. As such, the IRS retains a right to redeem this property until October 27, 2020. As a result, the sale of this parcel remains subject to cancellation with a full refund to the buyer if the IRS chooses to exercise its right of redemption. A deed issued following the sale of this property will thus contain the following reverter clause:\u201cThis conveyance is made subject to a right of redemption possessed by the Internal Revenue Service which must be exercised no later than October 27, 2020. In the event that the Internal Revenue Service exercises its right of redemption, title shall automatically revert to Grantor and Grantee shall be awarded a full refund. This possibility of reverter expires after October 27, 2020.\u201d", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/125737"},

IRS Limited Redemption Right This property is subject to redemption by the Internal Revenue Service through October 27, 2020 due to a lien possessed by the IRS prior to foreclosure. Pursuant to federal law, the Internal Revenue Service is granted an additional 120 days to redeem tax foreclosed property on which they possessed a lien. Normally, this extended redemption right has expired by the time tax foreclosed property is offered for sale. However, due to COVID-19, normal foreclosure timelines have been altered in 2020. As such, the IRS retains a right to redeem this property until October 27, 2020. As a result, the sale of this parcel remains subject to cancellation with a full refund to the buyer if the IRS chooses to exercise its right of redemption. A deed issued following the sale of this property will thus contain the following reverter clause:\u201cThis conveyance is made subject to a right of redemption possessed by the Internal Revenue Service which must be exercised no later than October 27, 2020. In the event that the Internal Revenue Service exercises its right of redemption, title shall automatically revert to Grantor and Grantee shall be awarded a full refund.

{"title": "Video Tour! Historic Building With Substantial Redevelopment Potential", "comments": "114 and 115 N Jackson are being sold as a single sale unit, with 115 being a parking lot that will accommodate approximately 40 cars. This property is located just north of Columbus Avenue, near St James Church. The earliest use of this building was as manufacturing, but it now lends itself to residential or mixed use redevelopment. As currently laid out it is a three story, brick building with a two story addition of more recent vintage. The original section features arched brickwork over the window openings. There is some decay in the brickwork, most of which is localized and much or it located around the original front door area. The newer addition section has roughly 50% window area in its wall design, which could create a bright and inviting interior with replacement windows. The addition area is also slab-on-grade construction and will support the weight of vehicles or heavy machinery on its main floor. The property is serviced by three phase and single phase power, as well as municipal 1.5\" potable water main, sewer and 2\" natural gas main @ 2000cfh.The building is fully sprinklered, and serviced by an 8\" water main. All of the mechanical systems in the building are dated, some have been harvested, and others are in a general state of disrepair. There are two elevators here, including an older freight elevator in the original structure, and a more modern ADA-type lift that appears to be in disrepair. The original portion of the building is three story, has hardwood floors that are restorable, and is based on a 10' x 10' post and beam load bearing design. The newer sections of the building are more open. The building is in need of roof repair, as sections of its EPDM membrane have separated are are leaking at seams. This is a substantial, solid, historic building located in a clean well maintained neighborhood. It has parking for 40 with alley access to improve navigation. The opportunities for redevelopment here are substantial. There are comprehensive engineering reports linked to this parcel that you may wish to review.

While a legal right to build such roads may remain, this construction would likely be very expensive. However, in some instances these unimproved roads have been vacated or abandoned by action of the local government and no such right to construct the roads remains. Issues surrounding unimproved roads can be complicated and expensive to resolve. You should investigate the existence of any roads and the ability to access this parcel thoroughly before bidding. This parcel does not front on a public or privately deeded improved road. Often times there are easements in the recorded chain-of-title that provide legal access to such parcels but other times there are not. You should thoroughly research this parcel's access rights prior to bidding. It can require expensive, complicated, and time consuming legal proceedings to secure legal access to landlocked parcels that do not have easements for ingress and egress.

IRS Limited Redemption Right This property is subject to redemption by the Internal Revenue Service through October 27, 2020 due to a lien possessed by the IRS prior to foreclosure. Pursuant to federal law, the Internal Revenue Service is granted an additional 120 days to redeem tax foreclosed property on which they possessed a lien. Normally, this extended redemption right has expired by the time tax foreclosed property is offered for sale. However, due to COVID-19, normal foreclosure timelines have been altered in 2020. As such, the IRS retains a right to redeem this property until October 27, 2020. As a result, the sale of this parcel remains subject to cancellation with a full refund to the buyer if the IRS chooses to exercise its right of redemption. A deed issued following the sale of this property will thus contain the following reverter clause:\u201cThis conveyance is made subject to a right of redemption possessed by the Internal Revenue Service which must be exercised no later than October 27, 2020. In the event that the Internal Revenue Service exercises its right of redemption, title shall automatically revert to Grantor and Grantee shall be awarded a full refund.

IRS Limited Redemption Right This property is subject to redemption by the Internal Revenue Service through November 17, 2020 due to a lien possessed by the IRS prior to foreclosure. Pursuant to federal law, the Internal Revenue Service is granted an additional 120 days to redeem tax foreclosed property on which they possessed a lien. Normally, this extended redemption right has expired by the time tax foreclosed property is offered for sale. However, due to COVID-19, normal foreclosure timelines have been altered in 2020. As such, the IRS retains a right to redeem this property until November 17, 2020. As a result, the sale of this parcel remains subject to cancellation with a full refund to the buyer if the IRS chooses to exercise its right of redemption. A deed issued following the sale of this property will thus contain the following reverter clause: \u201cThis conveyance is made subject to a right of redemption possessed by the Internal Revenue Service which must be exercised no later than November 17, 2020. In the event that the Internal Revenue Service exercises its right of redemption, title shall automatically revert to Grantor and Grantee shall be awarded a full refund.

Mold is an indication of excess moisture which can come from a variety of sources including high ground water, improper sealing of foundation walls, damaged roofs, and other conditions which can be expensive to correct. Mold can pose significant health risks and, if extensive, may require a complete renovation which could exceed the value of the building. Please conduct your own research and bid accordingly. One or more buildings on this parcel has a roof which is either leaking to the interior or appears close to failure. Failing roofs often indicate substantial structural decay inside the building.

Correcting foundation issues can be very expensive and issues are often more complex than they initially appear. You should research this issue thoroughly prior to bidding on this parcel.

Currently occupied IRS Limited Redemption Right This property is subject to redemption by the Internal Revenue Service through October 27, 2020 due to a lien possessed by the IRS prior to foreclosure. Pursuant to federal law, the Internal Revenue Service is granted an additional 120 days to redeem tax foreclosed property on which they possessed a lien. Normally, this extended redemption right has expired by the time tax foreclosed property is offered for sale. However, due to COVID-19, normal foreclosure timelines have been altered in 2020. As such, the IRS retains a right to redeem this property until October 27, 2020. As a result, the sale of this parcel remains subject to cancellation with a full refund to the buyer if the IRS chooses to exercise its right of redemption. A deed issued following the sale of this property will thus contain the following reverter clause:\u201cThis conveyance is made subject to a right of redemption possessed by the Internal Revenue Service which must be exercised no later than October 27, 2020. In the event that the Internal Revenue Service exercises its right of redemption, title shall automatically revert to Grantor and Grantee shall be awarded a full refund. This possibility of reverter expires after October 27, 2020.\u201d", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/123836"},

This Parcel is in a Rental Restrictions Overlay per City of East Lansing therefore it may not be used for a rental property. This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property. This parcel is part of a site condominium development. A condominium \"unit\" is a form of land ownership which is similar to a traditional subdivision \"lot\" but is also different in some important respects. Each condominium development is laid out in a document called the master deed which outlines the extent and nature of each condominium unit. The master deed also contains rules and restrictions related to construction and permitted use. Construction requirements can include everything from the size or design of buildings to color and orientation on the site. Condominium developments also include \"common elements\" like streets and sidewalks which are shared across all units. Some developments include amenities like golf courses, clubhouses, beaches, pools, and parks whereas others include only basic infrastructure like roads and sidewalks. Site condominiums also include association fees which can be significant. Prospective bidders should carefully review and understand the master deed and investigate association fees prior to bidding.

IRS Limited Redemption Right This property is subject to redemption by the Internal Revenue Service through October 27, 2020 due to a lien possessed by the IRS prior to foreclosure. Pursuant to federal law, the Internal Revenue Service is granted an additional 120 days to redeem tax foreclosed property on which they possessed a lien. Normally, this extended redemption right has expired by the time tax foreclosed property is offered for sale. However, due to COVID-19, normal foreclosure timelines have been altered in 2020. As such, the IRS retains a right to redeem this property until October 27, 2020. As a result, the sale of this parcel remains subject to cancellation with a full refund to the buyer if the IRS chooses to exercise its right of redemption. A deed issued following the sale of this property will thus contain the following reverter clause:\u201cThis conveyance is made subject to a right of redemption possessed by the Internal Revenue Service which must be exercised no later than October 27, 2020. In the event that the Internal Revenue Service exercises its right of redemption, title shall automatically revert to Grantor and Grantee shall be awarded a full refund.

It appears that whoever was here most recently knew they weren't coming back foir a while, as they securely boarded the entrances to the trailer. We did get a peek-a-boo look through a broken window, and it appears to be solid inside as to overall condition, but it will likely need an overhaul. The exterior porch and outbuilding both have signs of rot, and there is an accumulation all over the yard of boats, campers and other personal property .... for the most part it is junk grade. Backs up to a vacant wooded acreage parcel that affords some privacy. At the end of a quiet road. Could be a decent handyman project as a northern escape. One or more structures was boarded when we conducted our assessment of this parcel. Properties may be boarded for a variety of reasons. For example, properties are often boarded to prevent trespassers from harvesting copper plumbing, wiring, and other fixtures. Buildings may also be boarded by fire or other officials when they present a safety hazard. We generally do not enter boarded structures and limit our observations to the building's exterior. Likewise, you should limit any inspection of this property to its exterior only. You are not permitted to remove any boarding to view building interiors under any circumstances. Public property records or polite inquiries to neighbors may reveal additional information about a property's history. The interior of this property was not viewed during our inspection. Buildings which are dangerous, occupied, boarded, condemned, or otherwise difficult to enter are inspected from the exterior/curbside only. You are NOT authorized to enter these or any other buildings offered for sale. You should limit your inspection to that which can be made safely from the building's exterior.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/121535"},

This property presents many options. There is still some personal property and equipment here that is not included in the sale. Building has basic power service, and there is municipal water and natural gas here as well. This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address.

IRS Limited Redemption Right This property is subject to redemption by the Internal Revenue Service through October 27, 2020 due to a lien possessed by the IRS prior to foreclosure. Pursuant to federal law, the Internal Revenue Service is granted an additional 120 days to redeem tax foreclosed property on which they possessed a lien. Normally, this extended redemption right has expired by the time tax foreclosed property is offered for sale. However, due to COVID-19, normal foreclosure timelines have been altered in 2020. As such, the IRS retains a right to redeem this property until October 27, 2020. As a result, the sale of this parcel remains subject to cancellation with a full refund to the buyer if the IRS chooses to exercise its right of redemption. A deed issued following the sale of this property will thus contain the following reverter clause:\u201cThis conveyance is made subject to a right of redemption possessed by the Internal Revenue Service which must be exercised no later than October 27, 2020. In the event that the Internal Revenue Service exercises its right of redemption, title shall automatically revert to Grantor and Grantee shall be awarded a full refund. This possibility of reverter expires after October 27, 2020.\u201d", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/127221"},
{"title": "Small Parcel With Limited Access", "comments": "Parcel sits to the rear of a home on County Farm Road west of Perch Lake, not far from Sidney. It is essentially 100 x 132 in size, and connects to the county road by a 19' wide access driveway which has not been cleared of trees and other blockage. So you can walk to it, but not drive. It is presently planted in corn (not included in sale). Mostly of use to the neighbors. The roads which are shown on plat or tax maps for this parcel do not appear to exist or may be located in a different location than shown on such maps. While a legal right to build such roads may remain, this construction would likely be very expensive. However, in some instances these unimproved roads have been vacated or abandoned by action of the local government and no such right to construct the roads remains. Issues surrounding unimproved roads can be complicated and expensive to resolve. You should investigate the existence of any roads and the ability to access this parcel thoroughly before bidding. A visual inspection of this parcel indicates that it contains a crop or planting which may have been made by a third party. These can range from single year crops like corn or grain to items such as christmas trees or other nursery stock which require more than one year to mature before harvest. Any third party lease has been voided through the foreclosure process. However, these situations can become points of potential litigation. In an effort to prevent dispute, the Foreclosing Governmental Unit will often grant single year farmers the right to harvest their crop as a condition of sale.

IRS Limited Redemption Right This property is subject to redemption by the Internal Revenue Service through October 27, 2020 due to a lien possessed by the IRS prior to foreclosure. Pursuant to federal law, the Internal Revenue Service is granted an additional 120 days to redeem tax foreclosed property on which they possessed a lien. Normally, this extended redemption right has expired by the time tax foreclosed property is offered for sale. However, due to COVID-19, normal foreclosure timelines have been altered in 2020. As such, the IRS retains a right to redeem this property until October 27, 2020. As a result, the sale of this parcel remains subject to cancellation with a full refund to the buyer if the IRS chooses to exercise its right of redemption. A deed issued following the sale of this property will thus contain the following reverter clause:\u201cThis conveyance is made subject to a right of redemption possessed by the Internal Revenue Service which must be exercised no later than October 27, 2020. In the event that the Internal Revenue Service exercises its right of redemption, title shall automatically revert to Grantor and Grantee shall be awarded a full refund.

{"title": "Church Or Hall Type Building. Ewen!", "comments": "This is a really well built, solid old wood frame building, that started it's life as church, before becoming a \"grow house\". Who would look there? The stained glass windows were harvested, and OSB slapped over the window openings without framing them in or insulating them. This will be a drafty place in the winter without correction. The roof is older, mid-life but isn't leaking. What little plumbing there is may have been winterized. It is essentially one large room upstairs with a side room/office space, and several small rooms in the basement. The building is suffering from moisture in the basement from being closed up, and mold is starting to form. This one can (and should) be saved, but she needs some ventilation and tightening up of the windows soon. Could be a great living, work or commercial space. Speculators: please study the market.

Many times such parcels are the result of survey or property transfer errors which create small orphaned slivers of land.

These parcels can often lead to adverse claims or encroachments by neighboring land owners which can be complicated legal issues to resolve.

These two lakes are the largest and most southern in a chain of six connected lakes. There is no public road to *any* of them according to topo maps. The net acreage here is roughly 20 acres, as the lakes (and connecting stream) cover much of the parcel.. We spoke with someone in the area that tells us that the property is primarily marshland, even though USGS topo maps don't show this. We found access to north end of the property off the verrrrrry end of Rosebush Road (left where Family Circle veers to the right). The road gradually becomes a very narrow overgrown and WET trail before it quite reaches the parcel and lake. It would be a good ATV access path, but a vehicle is going to get stuck in here (no place to turn around either) so BE CAREFUL. We are told that \"once upon a time\" this road was passable by vehicle and you could turn around at the end ... but that has been decades ago. With proper development, this could be a wonderful recreational parcel. Mayyyybe there is some uplands in here somewhere that would support construction. Hard to say. About 3.5 acres of the parcel sits west of the channel and has no access by land. This is an interesting parcel, but requires some investigation before bidding. There is a primitive boat launch on the end of W Rosebush Road at the eastern shore of Round Lake, but we do not believe this is public land or access. Our visual inspection indicated that electrical service was not available on or near this parcel. The nearest electric service appeared to be a considerable distance (hundreds or perhaps thousands of feet) from the property. As such, electrifying this parcel could be costly.

The interior is wide open, insulated (foam) but not finished. There is a new electrical service and a 4\" well as well as a well pit with hand driven shallow well. The property is wooded in mixed specie including some nice oaks and maples. Steel roof. Probably all about 20 years old or less here. Great wildlife area. Appears to be a septic here as well, but we cannot verify that ... you'll want to check with the local health department as to status. There is no kitchen or bath here .... just one wide open room. May have been a camper annex used on the concrete slab to the west of the cabin.

Mid aged maples are clearly the dominant specie all over this parcel. We found several overgrown two tracks on the county road about half-way along its border that travelled all way into sale unit 6002.

If you want to modify that agreement, you may have to repay some of the back tax amounts that were abated. Be aware of that and research carefully before bidding please! Also ... this parcel is on BOTH SIDES of the road at CR 413. There is a much better road on the portion west of 413 that runs west to the property boundary.

{"title": "Historic Stambaugh - The Bengal Mine", "comments": "This parcel is 20.7 acres. It is the location of the historic Bengal mine, and roughly 3/4's of it is now flooded and for all purposes a private pond. The property is fenced and there is not an easily accessed gate that we found. In places, the sheer bluff from the land to the water below is over 100 feet of sand. Hence the fence. We believe the water itself is similarly over 100 feet deep. We believe the pit (this was an open pit mine) is more level as to topography at the southern end, but did not breach the fence to find out. Could be an interesting property for the right visionary. But please recognize the potential liability and the responsibility to maintain the security of this property. A couple of trespassers stepping over the edge of that bluff could be a huge legal issue. Pay attention here, folks. Don't look at the water, look at the bluff. Also, erosion could eventually endanger Iris Street and the properties beyond. This parcel appears to have challenging terrain. Challenging terrain can include steep hillsides, ravines, gullies, or similar topographical features as well as little to no buildable area. Such parcels often have no practical use.

Mayyyyyyybe the foundation is reusable ... but that will require the house to be removed first. Not real practical. One or more structures was boarded when we conducted our assessment of this parcel. Properties may be boarded for a variety of reasons. For example, properties are often boarded to prevent trespassers from harvesting copper plumbing, wiring, and other fixtures. Buildings may also be boarded by fire or other officials when they present a safety hazard. We generally do not enter boarded structures and limit our observations to the building's exterior. Likewise, you should limit any inspection of this property to its exterior only. You are not permitted to remove any boarding to view building interiors under any circumstances. Public property records or polite inquiries to neighbors may reveal additional information about a property's history. The interior of this property was not viewed during our inspection. Buildings which are dangerous, occupied, boarded, condemned, or otherwise difficult to enter are inspected from the exterior/curbside only. You are NOT authorized to enter these or any other buildings offered for sale. You should limit your inspection to that which can be made safely from the building's exterior. This parcel includes a structure which should be considered DANGEROUS. This building has suffered structural damage which creates substantial risk of harm from falling through damaged areas or collapse from above. It may also contain extensive debris which could fall or collapse, rusty nails, broken glass, and other hazards. You are not permitted to enter this or any other structure offered at tax sale.

IRS Limited Redemption Right This property is subject to redemption by the Internal Revenue Service through October 27, 2020 due to a lien possessed by the IRS prior to foreclosure. Pursuant to federal law, the Internal Revenue Service is granted an additional 120 days to redeem tax foreclosed property on which they possessed a lien. Normally, this extended redemption right has expired by the time tax foreclosed property is offered for sale. However, due to COVID-19, normal foreclosure timelines have been altered in 2020. As such, the IRS retains a right to redeem this property until October 27, 2020. As a result, the sale of this parcel remains subject to cancellation with a full refund to the buyer if the IRS chooses to exercise its right of redemption. A deed issued following the sale of this property will thus contain the following reverter clause:\u201cThis conveyance is made subject to a right of redemption possessed by the Internal Revenue Service which must be exercised no later than October 27, 2020. In the event that the Internal Revenue Service exercises its right of redemption, title shall automatically revert to Grantor and Grantee shall be awarded a full refund.

To the north of the house is a detached, 2 car garage with a potential guest quarters over the top. It had a new roof and exterior stairway put on in 2017. There is already a guest quarters roughed in from past use, and it is plumbed for a kitchenette and bath, but we don't know anything about its function. Next to the two car garage is a large A-frame storage building. Easily long enough for a large workshop, or tractor storage. The acreage to the rear of the building is a mixture of specie and has a creek/drain that runs through the property. The road to the rear of the property appears to need to be built up to be suitable for regular vehicle use as there are spots that are overgrown and narrow where it crosses the lower lands up here. There is much useful upland here once you develop a way to get to it. Obviously it is very accessible by ATV. The house has natural gas hot water heat which was winterized in 2017, as was the plumbing. We cannot guarantee the work, but there should be no issue with the boiler or systems overall. The roof on the house is steel and isn't leaking. The living room has a nice corner window where there may have been lake views in the past, now grown up (most of these trees are on the property and could be thinned). There is one area in the laundry/utility room where the subfloor has been removed as it was spongy from a leaking washing machine. A sheet of plywood and that's as good as new. Overall, this is a solid, well built home with modern mechanicals that could use decor upgrades and maybe a new kitchen and bath. The master bedroom has one spot in its ceiling where the tiles have come loose and are sagging. It's not a leak ... just a sag. The two bedrooms share the bathroom with a Jack and Jill door setup. The property has an area to the north of the driveway near the road, where you could build a new garage that would minimize the work keeping the driveway open in the winter. This is located between Baraga and Houghton and roughly 10 miles from MTU. Note: This property is owned by the auction house and being sold \"as is\". Summer 2020 taxes are paid. The utilities at this property are active and can be switched over to the buyer at time of settlement. There is a lockbox at the property.

IRS Limited Redemption Right This property is subject to redemption by the Internal Revenue Service through October 27, 2020 due to a lien possessed by the IRS prior to foreclosure. Pursuant to federal law, the Internal Revenue Service is granted an additional 120 days to redeem tax foreclosed property on which they possessed a lien. Normally, this extended redemption right has expired by the time tax foreclosed property is offered for sale. However, due to COVID-19, normal foreclosure timelines have been altered in 2020. As such, the IRS retains a right to redeem this property until October 27, 2020. As a result, the sale of this parcel remains subject to cancellation with a full refund to the buyer if the IRS chooses to exercise its right of redemption. A deed issued following the sale of this property will thus contain the following reverter clause:\u201cThis conveyance is made subject to a right of redemption possessed by the Internal Revenue Service which must be exercised no later than October 27, 2020. In the event that the Internal Revenue Service exercises its right of redemption, title shall automatically revert to Grantor and Grantee shall be awarded a full refund.

As opposed to many schools we have offered over the year, this one is structurally still pretty solid AND it is small enough that it can be restored at a reasonable cost. The building is roughly 60' across the front and about 45 feet deep, or 2700 square feet. There are two floors. Importantly, it appears that the roof has been maintained all these years, even though it has been unoccupied for decades. With the exception of a couple of small areas (see photos) the plaster ceilings are intact. There is warping of the floors that we are assuming is the result of a period of time where the windows may have been broken and uncovered. Inside, the building was dry during our visit even after several rains. There is one spot in the center hallway where a vent or roof drain or some such leaks and has corrupted floors in the very center of the building. There is also an area near a side back door where the floor has given way, but re-decking should solve that issue. There are two large classrooms on the upper floor that would make magnificent living space, and the lower level could become storage and utility space. It also has an attached garage/workspace that is also in merchantable condition and could be restored. This building has antiquated mechanical systems, but there is three phase electricity here. The boiler was decommissioned years ago in favor of a mid century forced air fuel oil furnace. This building DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE A SEPTIC SYSTEM according to a neighbor who owns the property behind the building.

Retail down, owners quarters above would have been the original layout. We're not sure of the most recent use of the property, but the second floor was used for storage of some nature. Curiously, even though the exterior, second floor and attic are square and rock solid, the main floor is caving in to the basement level. We did not venture down below to find out, but our guess is that a load bearing post or other structural member in the basement has failed or been removed unwisely. Now the entire main floor is sinking into the basement. In time this will suck the whole thing in as the entire building is pulled out-of-square. This could likely be saved with fast action. This building has three phase 100A electric service. Are you the buyer for this one? This parcel includes a structure which should be considered DANGEROUS.

There is a substantial roof leak in the second floor bath, which is in the dormer at the left front side of the building. There is a good amount of frozen plumbing in evidence. To do this one right, it's probably time to strip it down to the studs and start over. It does have a modern hi efficiency furnace and 100A electrical service, so that's bonus points. The roof is older, but does not leak except at that dormer. This property contains physical indications that one or more water lines have frozen, ruptured, and leaked for a significant period of time prior to being shut off. Such indications can include damage to ceilings and floors and visibly damaged pipes and fixtures. Damage from freeze bursts can be substantial including significant harm to structural components such as framing and foundations. One or more buildings on this parcel has a roof which is either leaking to the interior or appears close to failure. Failing roofs often indicate substantial structural decay inside the building. You should investigate the integrity of this structure(s) prior to bidding. The previous owner of this parcel undertook a construction or rehabilitation project which has not been completed.

{"title": "Unfinished Modular And Pole Barn Project. Bark River.", "comments": "This is an incomplete construction project that was halted by the building code official. There is a modular home here that is sitting on a concrete slab (partial) without sufficient footings or perimeter enclosure. Because of that deficiency, the property has been CONDEMNED. That's not a demolition order .... but it IS a citation that means you CANNOT LIVE HERE until the property is brought into compliance with code. The modulars interior is unfinished and also a work in progress. There is a spartan kitchen setup, and there is speculation that the well and septic may not be operable or to code either. We strongly suggest having a conversation with the local code enforecement folks if you plan to bid on this. Chances are that if you put a proper foundation under this and finish the inside, you'll be fine. Just don't plan on living here soon. The interior floor plan has also been modified, and there are a couple of frame additions to the original design. BONUS: There is a roughly 40x50 steel barn here to be completed. It does not yet have a concrete floor or overhead doors, so this will also require finishing before occupancy. There is a good amount of personal property on site here that is NOT INCLUDED in this sale, and remains the property of the former owner. The electrical service panel is 100A, but the wiring at the panel is romex salad and will need correction before it is safe. This parcel has been posted as \"Condemned\" by the local building authority. Properties are generally condemned when they are deemed substandard, unsafe, or otherwise unfit for use and habitation. Condemned property must be rehabilitated to meet local building codes prior to use or occupancy. A building is not automatically slated for demolition when condemned. However, this does not necessarily mean that demolition will not also be pursued by the local unit. Please check with the local building official before bidding to determine the specific status and requirements for this property.

You should research this issue thoroughly prior to bidding on this parcel. IRS Limited Redemption Right This property is subject to redemption by the Internal Revenue Service through October 27, 2020 due to a lien possessed by the IRS prior to foreclosure. Pursuant to federal law, the Internal Revenue Service is granted an additional 120 days to redeem tax foreclosed property on which they possessed a lien. Normally, this extended redemption right has expired by the time tax foreclosed property is offered for sale. However, due to COVID-19, normal foreclosure timelines have been altered in 2020. As such, the IRS retains a right to redeem this property until October 27, 2020. As a result, the sale of this parcel remains subject to cancellation with a full refund to the buyer if the IRS chooses to exercise its right of redemption. A deed issued following the sale of this property will thus contain the following reverter clause:\u201cThis conveyance is made subject to a right of redemption possessed by the Internal Revenue Service which must be exercised no later than October 27, 2020. In the event that the Internal Revenue Service exercises its right of redemption, title shall automatically revert to Grantor and Grantee shall be awarded a full refund. This possibility of reverter expires after October 27, 2020.\u201d", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/121676"},

This is a well built home and has a private compound feel to it. Structurally, this is a very very solid property. However the last occupant appears to have been somewhat of a hoarder and all of the buildings are LOADED, wall-to-wall with \"stuff\". It's not so much garbage as it is just clutter. And there is a LOT of it. To compound that, it looks like someone broke in and rooted through the entire place looking for things of value. It has been pretty thoroughly ransacked and every thing turned inside out. They busted up a few door jambs, so that, and one woodpecker mesting site on the side of the house are the only real issues we could find here. The main house has three bedrooms, one down and two up. One bath. Forced air heat (probably propane). It is solid and mostly just needs to be emptied and cleaned up. The detached two car garage has an attached workshop. Across the way is a shop building ... almost like a small service business or store space, with an attacked one car garage, Great spot for a contractor or other self employed person to separate work and home life. There is a double bay storage shed for yard things and extra manstuff, and last but not least a SAUNA for those chilly winter evenings. This is a very very nice set up that any man (or woman!) would love to have. Storage for days, and lots of workspace for projects.

IRS Limited Redemption Right This property is subject to redemption by the Internal Revenue Service through October 27, 2020 due to a lien possessed by the IRS prior to foreclosure. Pursuant to federal law, the Internal Revenue Service is granted an additional 120 days to redeem tax foreclosed property on which they possessed a lien. Normally, this extended redemption right has expired by the time tax foreclosed property is offered for sale. However, due to COVID-19, normal foreclosure timelines have been altered in 2020. As such, the IRS retains a right to redeem this property until October 27, 2020. As a result, the sale of this parcel remains subject to cancellation with a full refund to the buyer if the IRS chooses to exercise its right of redemption.

It was occupied until fairly recently. Appears to have been a duplex from day one, and not a hatchetjob. The units show sign of the typical rental abuse ... splintered jambs and interior doors and walls that have been repaired/replaced. Utilities are separated including water. House is served by two older boilers which may be near the end of their serviceable life and there is notable decay in the steam piping. Water, power and gas were available during our inspection, and we could not get either of the boilers to fire. Could be an expensive upgrade/replacement. The interior is straight and mostly in need of deep cleaning and aesthetics. Each unit is 2 bedrooms and a bath, and there are 2 parking spaces which could be stacked to accommodate 4 cars if necessary but it would be congested. Upper unit rear porch is rotten, unsafe and needs immediate replacement. Upper unit bathroom has water leakage from upper bath to the unit below and will require plumbing and ceiling repair. There is a sump pump in the basement that ejects into the side yard, and there is an excavation in the basement floor nearby that indicates some sort of subsurface repair or other issue. We also noticed a floor drain type fixture out in the back yard (?) which may infer that there are issues with the sewer line or a drainage problem. There is some missing tuckpoint in the foundation. Kitchens and baths are fairly modern, but pretty box-store cheap and generic, The plumbing workmanship is questionable and probably DIY. In the proper hands, this could be a pretty nice property, but it will take some work. Large rear yard is partly fenced. The building on this property appears to have been used for multi-family occupancy in the past based upon indicators such as multiple mailboxes, entrances, numbering, layout, or other such factors.

The only detriment we would note to this parcel is the power line on the next parcel ... however that also means no neighbor on that side, permanently. Wooded in nice evergreens and a gentle rolling hillside. This would be a great place for your new Traverse City address. There *could* be a HOA/POA here ... do your research.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/122022"},
{"title": "Small Parcel In Thompsonville", "comments": "This is a triangular parcel at the south boundary of Thompsonville, where South and Front Streets meet. It is the bottomlands of a ravine, and is about two feet below road grade. The lands here do not appear to be wet, but the vegetation is dense toward the rear of the parcel and it could be a little moist toward the rear.There is municipal water here. Parcel is about 1/2 acre in size, and it's adjoined on the north by unimproved platted street which would add to property size if vacated.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/120548"},
{"title": "Very Nice Long-Ten Acre Parcel Not Too Far From Empire.", "comments": "Parcel fronts 330' on Way Road and runs about 1320' feet deep = 10+ acres. Lots of nice maples on this property. It is generally level, with a bit of a dip near the center. There is a two track that runs in along the north line of the parcel, finds a clearing about 100 feet into the parcel, and then continues along the north side of the parcel where a tree has falled across the trail. This is a very nice, wooded parcel waiting for your recreation or home use. About 5 miles southeast of Empire. Nice property in a quiet rural setting !!", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/120546"},
{"title": "1+ Acre Building Site In Bendon !", "comments": "Parcel is 125' feet along Bendon Road and runs 363' feet deep. The lot has adornments including an old boat, building materials, and an old pool. There is a partial foundation remaining, suggesting that a structure that was here either burned or was removed. This is nice, level well drained soil and should easily support new construction. We assume there is a well and septic here somewhere, but cannot speak to their suitability for repurposing.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/120540"},
{"title": "10+ Acres !!! Us 31. High Traffic. Commercial Potential. Interlochen Area", "comments": "High traffic counts in this commercial potential parcel west of Interlochen on US 31 !! Parcel fronts roughly 240' feet along the highway and runs over 2000' feet deep = 10+ acres. It also has a narrow dogleg strip to the rear that seems to possibly connect it to Sleepy Hollow Drive by an overgrown trail. You may wish to verify the legal access over that strip if it is important to you. The property is slightly rolling, dry and wide open land in the front half, and evergreen grove in the rear. .", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/120537"},
{"title": "Older, Overgrown Home In Elberta", "comments": "Appears to have been vacant since roughly 2016. Older home in Elberta, just up the street a bit from the Cabbage Shed. The forward portion of the home appears to be generally solid, but the rear addition has a pretty significant section of rot. The interior of the house is LOADED with personal property, to the degree that it was difficult to navigate or determine condition in detail. We did notice that the floor appears to have sloped downward to the left side of the bathtub, as well as behind the laundry appliances on the other side of that same wall. This suggests to us that there is decay and structural weakness of some sort in that area. Overall the roof appears to be okay, however there is a gaping hole in the rear wall at the corner of the house near the back door ... open to the elements ... and allowing critters access to the interior. It smells of food garbage and animal odors inside. We could not find any access to a basement (if there is one) or to the second floor which appears to be furnished ... so there must be access somewhere. We suspect that a large cabinet or other item could be in front of that stairway, or that it is in a part of the home that we could not get to because of the accumulation. There is significant personal property inside this home that we do not have title for and is not included in the sale. Abandoned vehicle in the rear. This one will need to be emptied out before its real condition can be ascertained. In general, the forward (2 story section) of the home seems solid. The rear addition (1 story) has some decay issues. This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property. This property is unsanitary and poses a potential health hazard because of raw food garbage, backed up sewer lines, or other similar waste. Such conditions can attract rodents, wild animals, and other vermin. You should bid accordingly and be prepared to mitigate the situation immediately upon purchase.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/120534"},
{"title": "8+ Acres Neat Thompsonville.", "comments": "This parcel does not front on any public road, but appears to have physical access through the parcel to its west off Thompsonville Road. During our visit in mid August, there was a camper here with a generator running for power, so we're suggesting that this property is OCCUPIED at this time and you should investigate from a distance.
