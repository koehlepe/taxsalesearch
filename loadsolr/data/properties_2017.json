{"title": "Commercial Building In City Of Vassar", "comments": "Commercial building located in Vassar, formerly a restaurant. Commercial supplies and property left inside building. Some mold apparent in ceiling due to water damage. This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property. One or more buildings on this parcel has a roof which is either leaking to the interior or appears close to failure. Failing roofs often indicate substantial structural decay inside the building. You should investigate the integrity of this structure(s) prior to bidding.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/101690"},

It is in need of a roof ... if not now ... soon. Thru the windows we see some features like arched doorways and wood floors that probably could be refinished. Has a large yard with alley service. Municipal utilities and natural gas service here. Walking distance to downtown. This is the larger of the two houses we have in Newberry this year. The interior of this property was not viewed during our inspection. Buildings which are dangerous, occupied, boarded, condemned, or otherwise difficult to enter are inspected from the exterior/curbside only.

{"title": "Manistique Home. Some Rehabbing Already Done!", "comments": "The outside of this one is fairly fresh and should not need much work. Newer shingle roof and siding (needs a couple of spots repaired) all seem good-to-go. Inside, this one is *grubby*. It also seemed to miss the rehab, tho it has newer windows thru-out. All of the interior surfaces will need a strip and replace. Heavy animal/pet odors. Kitchen and bath are low grade and worn out. Three bedrooms, one bath. Only the front two rooms on the second floor are finished (and they're \"decor challenged\"). The rear portions are low ceiling attic space. The hot water heat system here is pretty beat up and probably needs a rehabbing of its own. This could be a decent house, and it has a good start outside. Bring the scrub brush and clean up !", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/101596"},

{"title": "Occupied Mobile In Onaway!", "comments": "Parcel contains an older mobile home with a carport. It is OCCUPIED and there are a couple of smaller dogs here tending to guard duty. Because it is occupied, we did not have the opportunity to view it in detail. Small lot in the village of Onaway. Overall this one is in merchantable condition and appears to be fairly well maintained. Mobile homes (and some modular homes) can be separately titled and considered personal property. In these instances, there may be third parties that have the legal right to remove that mobile home from the parcel whether or not it has been assessed as part of the property in the past. We make no representations or warranties as to whether such mobile or modular homes are included with the real property offered for sale. It is the buyer\u2019s responsibility to conduct their own research as to the state of title. As a preliminary step, it may be useful to determine if an Affidavit of Affixture of Manufactured Home has been executed and recorded as outlined in MCL 125.2330i. You may wish to consult a licensed attorney or title company to assist in this research. This property is occupied. Please respect the privacy of current occupants and limit any inspection to what can be safely observed from the road. Some occupants may be upset or angry and may meet contact with aggression or violence. Please use discretion and caution when researching this or other occupied properties. Furthermore, although this property has been foreclosed for unpaid taxes, occupants have certain rights under Michigan law and must be formally evicted if unwilling to leave voluntarily. You may wish to consult a licensed attorney for more information. The interior of this property was not viewed during our inspection.

{"title": "Mid Century Rancher In Onaway. Very Bad Roof.", "comments": "This home has has a very, very bad roof, for a very, very long time. The decay in places here is advanced. This was a very good quality mid-century home that probably was in pretty decent condition until the last 10 or 15 years. The roof should have been replaced outright at that point, but instead, several poorly executed attempts were made to extend its life with patches and seals that did not work particularly well. Inside, most spots are unaffected,m in the locations where the leaks were prolonged, the decay went unabated for years and there will be significant repair to do. There is a fine mold covering many surfaces here. It likely needs to be completely gutted and all surfaces (except some maple flooring that can be preserved) redone after first getting a new roof. We believe that the substructure here is still generally sound, but there are certainly pockets of advanced decay. The basement exhibits upgraded mechanicals, but they need attention. Our synopsis of this one is that it is not in such a condition that it needs to be demolished .. \"yet\" ... but it is headed that way. It could still be restored, but you're looking at a good deal of work. And there may be some surprises once you start deconstruction toward that goal. One or more buildings on this parcel has a roof which is either leaking to the interior or appears close to failure. Failing roofs often indicate substantial structural decay inside the building.

{"title": "Modular Home On A Corner Lot. Karlin.", "comments": "This is a nice corner lot in the small village of Karlin, a few miles south and west of Interlochen and Traverse City. The unit was a bank repo and has been sittin for a few years. There is deferred maintenance evident on the exterior, and it will need some soffit work. If you're looking for an entry level home in the pricey TC market, this may be the ticket. 150A electric service. The furnace has been harvested. Well, septic and propane heat utilities. This one is solid, but grubby. A resurfacing would do wonders. This property is marked as winterized, but the work was done in late December, so there may well have been some freeze damage to plumbing prior to that taking place. A third party lender has claimed an interest in this property, but we expect that issue will be resolved prior to sale in August. The foreclosure of this property may be subject to legal challenge by the former owner or another party of interest. Therefore, this parcel may be withheld from the sale if a legal action is commenced prior to the auction. The status of any such legal action, to the extent known, will be disclosed if the property is auctioned as planned. Bidders are advised that the cost of defending legal title after the auction is wholly the responsibility of the purchaser. Please conduct your own research and investigate any potential legal issues prior to bidding. There is evidence posted which indicates that a lender may be attempting to foreclose upon this parcel after such parcel was foreclosed for delinquent property taxes. A purchaser may encounter future contact from this lender. Tax foreclosure supersedes the rights of mortgage holders. If a mortgage holder does not foreclose upon their mortgage interest prior to tax foreclosure, their right to do so is generally lost. Typically such mortgage holders were provided all necessary notice of tax foreclosure but failed to act in a timely fashion to preserve their interest. In rare instances it may be necessary to cancel a sale if a deficiency in notice to such a lender is discovered. Please contact us or ask questions at the sale if you have concerns about this issue.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/99662"},

Our review of this parcel indicates that the noted State Equalized Value (SEV) does not appear to reflect the current value of the property. This is often due to buildings or other improvements being demolished or fire damaged or other similar items included in the SEV being removed from the property. It can also be due to market changes in the area in which the property is located. It should be further noted that the SEV/assessed value of the parcel as noted in this listing may be several years old. You should consult a local real estate professional or appraiser to help you assess the current market value of this property before bidding and should not base your valuation on the stated SEV.

This is a stalled rehab project that is incomplete.It appears that this was used as a duplex, and the conversion effort was amateur. There is a lot still to be done here, but the \"bones\" appear to be straight and solid. The side porch on the main floor has a bad roof, but it has not seriously impacted the rest of the structure \"yet\".

The previous owner of this parcel undertook a construction or rehabilitation project which has not been completed. We have attempted to describe the degree to which the project has been finished, but the building should be be considered incomplete nonetheless. The local building code enforcement official may be able to offer additional insight as to why the project was never completed. This one still contains substantial personal property belonging to the last owner. We did not have the opportunity to view it in detail.It is an older frame structure with newer steel roof. This building is subject to demolition if a grant, which has been applied for, is funded. Please keep in mind that the seller reserves the right to demolish this structure.If it is your intention to purchase it for rehabilitation, we'd suggest that you discuss this with the treasurers office BEFORE bidding.

This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property. The structure(s) on this parcel have been slated for demolition by the local unit of government prior to sale. As such, it is being presented here as a vacant lot. You should confirm the status of this parcel as well as the allocation of the cost of demolition prior to bidding. The interior of this property was not viewed during our inspection. Buildings which are dangerous, occupied, boarded, condemned, or otherwise difficult to enter are inspected from the exterior/curbside only.

Older 1.5 story home in Manistique on a 56' x 171.5' deep lot on Delta Avenue.The home is grubby and cosmetically challenged, but generally straight and sound. There are two bedrooms and a third storage type room that could be a child bedroom but has no window to meet egress code. The roof is older, but we saw no evidence of leaks.

Home needs an interior and exterior rehab and resurface. The roof and foundation here are both sketchy, but neither have transmitted those weaknesses to the interior, \"yet\". There is a lot of rot in the eaves and soffits that has probably crept inward to the roof system.The hardwood floor is buckled, a sign of either moisture or frequently of frozen plumbing. It is missing its front porch, and the second floor is only partially completed.This home is on a list of those to potentially be demolished with grant funds that have been applied for.

This one has been a frequent flyer several times over the years. This time we've put it on a special list of properties to be demolished, assuming the grant application is funded. The home is boarded and needs everything. A foundation, roof, all the mechanicals (has a newer electric service, but the innards are incomplete) ... inside ... outside .... it needs everything. It probably needs a bulldozer the most of all.

One or more structures was boarded when we conducted our assessment of this parcel. Properties may be boarded for a variety of reasons. For example, properties are often boarded to prevent trespassers from harvesting copper plumbing, wiring, and other fixtures. Buildings may also be boarded by fire or other officials when they present a safety hazard. We generally do not enter boarded structures and limit our observations to the building's exterior. Likewise, you should limit any inspection of this property to its exterior only. You are not permitted to remove any boarding to view building interiors under any circumstances. Public property records or polite inquiries to neighbors may reveal additional information about a property's history.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/104629"},

Our review of this parcel indicates that the noted State Equalized Value (SEV) does not appear to reflect the current value of the property. This is often due to buildings or other improvements being demolished or fire damaged or other similar items included in the SEV being removed from the property. It can also be due to market changes in the area in which the property is located. It should be further noted that the SEV/assessed value of the parcel as noted in this listing may be several years old. You should consult a local real estate professional or appraiser to help you assess the current market value of this property before bidding and should not base your valuation on the stated SEV. This parcel is located within a municipality which monitors property maintenance and condition. You may be assessed fees and fines if you fail to mow the grass or do not otherwise properly maintain the property after purchase.

Construction requirements can include everything from the size or design of buildings to color and orientation on the site.

The large brick building on the corner was probably quite the building in its day, but it has deteriorated to the degree that any attempt at restoring it would be an exercise in fiscal futility.

Inside, there is much advanced decay, with rotten wood everywhere. Buckled floors. unsafe in numerous places. Quite simply, the value here is in the land, which is on US 31 in the village at a very high visibility location. There is also a small home to the rear that is is better shape than the front building, but still economically beyond realistic rehabilitation. It has no functioning plumbing and has been chopped up by someone harvesting its various parts. In short, these two are dozer bait. The value here is in the land.

The main floor walls have been plastered with a rough texture that would be much improved with new sheet rock. Or you could just leave it the way it is. The second floor has two bedrooms and a very oddly arranged bath tub set up that could best be described as \"cobbled\". It is enclosed in a glass walled trim piece that clearly had some other original purpose. Overall, this is a pretty basic structure that could be used as it is with some basic repairs. But it has greater potential with some cosmetic upgrades. In either instance, it's going to need a roof and mechanicals replaced in order to serve the purpose for any substantial period of time. If you held an interest in this parcel prior to foreclosure and wish to buy it back, you are required by law to pay at least the minimum bid which was placed on the property during the first round auction. You are not eligible to purchase this property for the lower \"no reserve\" amount offered at this second round sale. The minimum bid includes all delinquent taxes, interest, penalties, and fees that were due on the property at the time of foreclosure.

{"title": "Older Fire-Damaged Duplex In Crystal Falls!", "comments": "This is an older frame structure in Crystal Falls that needs a good deal of work. It was originally a single family home, then (not especially well) converted to a duplex. The foundation is covered, but we suspect it is a wood pier footing system and failing. The roof is old and sketchy looking. There is an exterior entrance to the second floor apartment that is showing signs of decay. Inside, the main floor walls and ceiling are covered in soot, suggesting that there has been a fire in here, or a really hazardous heating system was used. It could probably be deep cleaned (we didn't see any fire damage beyond the soot) but the house overall is of poor condition, needs a complete resurfacing inside and out, and it may or may not warrant the investment. If you held an interest in this parcel prior to foreclosure and wish to buy it back, you are required by law to pay at least the minimum bid which was placed on the property during the first round auction.

The building on this property appears to have been used for multi-family occupancy in the past based upon indicators such as multiple mailboxes, entrances, numbering, layout, or other such factors. Modifications to the property may NOT have been legally made and may NOT conform to local zoning. Prospective bidders should verify with local officials that multi-family use is permitted under existing zoning. In many areas, once a multi-family use has been discontinued, it cannot be reinstated unless in conformance with local zoning and code. This parcel includes structures which have been damaged by fire. It is up to the auction purchaser to determine if this property can be restored to a safe condition and to comply with all relevant local regulations and building codes. Please research thoroughly prior to bidding.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/104694"},

Evidence of the posting of a CASH PERFORMANCE BOND or equivalent surety, shall be presented to the Seller or its designee for acceptance within 5 days of the auction. The seller has the unilateral right to accept, reject or require modification to the proposed instrument. If an acceptable bond or surety is not presented within the period, the sale shall be canceled for non-performance without refund. The purchaser has NO RIGHT TO POSSESSION or entry upon the property until the issuance and recording of the deed. There are two structures here under a common storefront facade. The east building is an old wood frame two story traditional retail walk up. Probably 100 years old or more. The west addition is a mid century concrete block one story structure. Both have sketchy looking old roofs that have been patched, coated and mostly ignored. Surprisingly, the leakage inside is almost nil. But we'd get a new roof on this one before the nastiness creeps inside. The interior has been joined and carved up into more than a dozen office type rooms. Most of the building has paneling and drop ceilings. This property has potential. Do you have a use for it ? It appears the last use was a resale-secondhand store and residence. There is a large tree that has fallen to the rear. Near miss. Almost had some major roof damage.

Home is situated on a double (60'x120') lot near Caspians \"main drag\". The exterior is faux brick asphalt. And the roof is older, but seems pretty serviceable for the near term.The inside is straight and solid. Someone has harvested just about every light fixture, so you'll need to replace all of those. The kitchen and bath could both use a freshening up, but they're adequate. Nice landscape that could be trimmed up and made to look sharp. The front porch here is cantilevered, and it may be missing some sort of structural support at the corners. You will want to take a good look at that. This one could be made back into someones Home Sweet Home without a tremendous investment.

This is a sharp little bungalow style home in Caspian that has a horrid foundation. Some cracks are evident at the front left corner of the house, but the backside is where you really see the damage. An effort was made to put some plywood over it, but most of the back foundation is shifting into the basement.This is a sharp little house, but it really, really really needs to either be lifted onto a new foundation, OR simply moved to a new lot nearby.There are nice hardwood floors here, buckling from a combination of the foundation issues and the dampness that permits to enter. 2-3 bedrooms and one bath here.

This parcel has substantial structural issues caused by poor design, insufficient maintenance, or both. Such buildings may be subject to condemnation orders which we were unable to locate during our inspection. All such buildings should be brought into compliance with local building regulations prior to use. We strongly recommend that you contact the local building code official and consider consulting a competent structural engineer to assess the condition of this property before to bidding. The interior of this property was not viewed during our inspection. Buildings which are dangerous, occupied, boarded, condemned, or otherwise difficult to enter are inspected from the exterior/curbside only. You are NOT authorized to enter these or any other buildings offered for sale. You should limit your inspection to that which can be made safely from the building's exterior. This parcel includes a structure which should be considered DANGEROUS. This building has suffered structural damage which creates substantial risk of harm from falling through damaged areas or collapse from above. It may also contain extensive debris which could fall or collapse, rusty nails, broken glass, and other hazards. You are not permitted to enter this or any other structure offered at tax sale. You should limit your inspection only to what can be safely observed from the building's exterior. Trespassers are subject to prosecution. Someone started rehabbing this home, even though the foundation here is shot.Has a partial roof that is very new higher grade architectural style shingles. Seems the equivalent of putting lipstick on a pig ... doesn't it ? There may be something beyond just a foundation issue here as well, as we noticed that the driveway paving is itself cracking and rolling under the house. So there could very well be something unstable under the surface here beyond the extent of the foundation walls. The land to the west is a hillside ... and this could be the result of decades of washout. There is also a one car garage here. It may have potential use to an adjacent property owner.

If you'd like to have a look at the structure required by the Master Deed, there are already 5 duplex units built here that are examples. This project sits along the banks of the Menominee River, with Wisconsin right across the way. The seller reserve the right to create a deed restriction, prohibiting the \"splitting\" of these unbuilt units for resale prior to the physical construction and issuance of certificates of occupancy for each two unit duplex building. This would permit a successor developer the opportunity to build one at a time, but would discourage speculators from trying to \"flip\" condos that do not even exist. They will have a deed restriction that they CANNOT BE EITHER OFFERED FOR SALE, OR RESOLD INDIVIDUALLY OR IN ANY COMBINATION, UNLESS AND UNTIL CONSTRUCTED AND AN OCCUPANCY PERMIT ISSUED FOR EACH UNIT or title will revert to the Dickinson County Treasurer without compensation. This permits a developer to built one unit at a time if they choose. This bundle is eight proposed units, and being sold as one auction parcel bundle. If you're intent on bidding on this bundle, please be certain that you understand the ramifications of a reverter clause when used as a deed restriction.

You are not eligible to purchase this property for the lower \"no reserve\" amount offered at this second round sale. The minimum bid includes all delinquent taxes, interest, penalties, and fees that were due on the property at the time of foreclosure. See MCL 211.78m(5) for more information. One or more buildings on this parcel has a roof which is either leaking to the interior or appears close to failure. Failing roofs often indicate substantial structural decay inside the building.

Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property. The foundation of one or more buildings located on this parcel appears to be failing. Correcting foundation issues can be very expensive and issues are often more complex than they initially appear. You should research this issue thoroughly prior to bidding on this parcel. Pet and/or wild animal waste was observed within this property.

{"title": "33 Foot Strip With No Road Access. Kinross.", "comments": "Parcel is 33 feet wide x 660 feet long strip that runs across the north line of the SW of the NE of the NW 1/4 of Section 34. It has little use to anyone other than the owner of adjacent lands. If you held an interest in this parcel prior to foreclosure and wish to buy it back, you are required by law to pay at least the minimum bid which was placed on the property during the first round auction. You are not eligible to purchase this property for the lower \"no reserve\" amount offered at this second round sale. The minimum bid includes all delinquent taxes, interest, penalties, and fees that were due on the property at the time of foreclosure. See MCL 211.78m(5) for more information. This parcel is what we refer to as a 33'/66'. We frequently see foreclosed parcels that are either 33 or 66 feet wide. These parcels are often a result of existing or former road rights of way. A common road right of way is 66 feet wide. Half of that is 33 feet. There are two common scenarios that we see. Scenario 1: A land owner splits a tract of land and creates a common easement parcel for access. They might then quit paying taxes on the parcel with road frontage knowing that the easement would remain even after foreclosure. Such easements are generally either 33 or 66 feet wide. Scenario 2: Rural land generally runs to the center of any public road on which it fronts whereas subdivided land usually runs to the edge of the road right-of-way. Sometimes during surveys or other splits, half of the right-of-way (usually 33 feet) can become orphaned, effectively turning to no-man's-land. Potential bidders should be aware that 33 and 66 foot wide parcels are very likely to include easements. That means that there are people who have a right to use the property even though they do not own the land. It is unlawful to cut off access over a 33 or 66 foot parcel where an easement already exists. Even if an easement doesn't already exists, courts will frequently create such an easement to prevent a neighboring parcel from becoming landlocked. Potential bidders should consider that this parcel likely has little value and cannot be used to landlock a neighboring parcel when there is no other path for ingress and egress.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/104581"},

{"title": "Bundle", "comments": "ATTN: No online bidding for this lot. The parcels in this sale unit are grouped, (\"bundled\") as permitted by MCL 211.78m. Many of these include structures which contain lead based paint. Some may contain asbestos. Many are in various stages of disrepair or collapse and are considered dangerous buildings and attractive nuisance. Some may be occupied by tenants-holding-over under law. These parcels are not being offered individually. They must be purchased as a single bundle at or above the minimum bid price, if any is stated. Pursuant to MCL 211.78 (1), the Foreclosing Governmental Unit (FGU) has determined that the most efficient and expeditious method to return many of these parcels to productive use, is to require their immediate demolition, remediation, rehabilitation or repurposing if sold at auction. Many of these parcels constitute blight, a public nuisance and abatement is considered necessary. Before their sale to ANY purchaser at auction, it is the intent of the FGU that any such purchaser shall demonstrate their financial ability and willingness to perform those actions necessary, in the public interest and welfare, to bring the properties into compliance with local codes and ordinances. Therefore, it is a further requirement of sale of the bundled properties that a purchaser must demolish, remediate, rehabilitate or repurpose these properties as follows: 1) ALL STRUCTURES must be secured and made un-enterable within 15 days of sale at auction, at the purchasers sole expense, or the sale shall be cancelled and no refund or deed issued. 2) Any visible refuse, garbage, trash or other cast off shall be removed from lands within 15 days of the sale at auction, at the purchasers sole expense, or the sale shall be cancelled and no refund or deed issued.. 3) The conditions required in (1) and (2) above shall be maintained against further entry or blight for a period of 12 months following the execution of a deed. 4) Those properties in the bundle that are beyond reasonable repair or economic vitality to repair must be demolished at the sole expense of the purchaser. The cost of such work shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. All such demolition must be performed within 6 months of deeding, by a licensed, insured demolition contractor acceptable to the code official of the local unit of government where the property is located. All proper permits for demolition and the removal and disposal of volatile debris (asbestos, contaminants etc) must be obtained. 5) Those properties in the bundle which appear to either the purchaser, FGU or the code enforcement official of the local unit of government to be potentially contaminated, shall be the subject of a Baseline Environmental Assessment (BEA) at the sole expense of the purchaser. The cost of such BEA(s) shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. The BEA(s) shall be conducted by an insured environmental consultant licensed in the State of Michigan within 45 days of purchase, and shall be fully complete and filed with the proper authorities within 90 days of purchase. The level of the BEA to be conducted shall be determined by the findings of the initial phase(s) of the BEA at each parcel subject to such study. Where contamination is evident, the purchaser shall indemnify the FGU with a separate performance bond (issued on the same terms as others herein required) in an amount equal to the full cost of remediation of the contamination at each such site, and for a period of twenty (20) years, unless remediation is undertaken and completed during that time period. If the site is remediated to a level satisfactory to state officials charged with such determinations, the requirement for a performance bond shall be removed for that site. 6) Those properties in the bundle which can be rehabilitated or repurposed shall be brought into compliance with all construction, occupancy, zoning and other use codes of the local unit of government within 12 months. Construction and/or mechanical permits must be obtained prior to performing such work. Occupancy permits must be obtained by the expiration of that term. All construction and rehabilitation work at these properties shall be carried out by contractors that are licensed and insured, and acceptable to the code enforcement officer of the local unit of government. The cost of such work shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. In pursuance of those requirements and their costs and timelines, the FGU is requiring the posting of a performance bond in the amount of $450,000.00. The performance bond shall be made out in favor of the Office of the Bay County Treasurer (acting as the Foreclosing Governmental Unit). Evidence of the issuance and full payment for such bond shall be presented to the FGU within fifteen (15) days of the acceptance of the purchasers bid at auction. In the event evidence of issuance and full payment is not tendered within fifteen (15) days of sale, the sale shall be cancelled outright, and the purchaser considered non-responsive to a necessary condition of the sale. No receipt for the sale shall be issued, and the bidder shall not be entitled to enter upon such premises, until such bond is issued and deemed sufficient by the FGU. Such bond shall be issued by an underwriter licensed to do business in the State of Michigan, who is not the subject of any pending disciplinary action by the State of Michigan or any department, bureau or commission thereof. It shall be payable, in full amount, to the FGU in the event of either whole or partial non-performance of the terms above written for its entire duration. It shall run as effective and be fully pre-paid, for the entire term of twenty-four (24) months. Any overage or refund shall be payable to the purchaser upon earlier termination of the bond because of full performance hereunder. This 24 month time period is not applicable to those performance bonds required for contaminated parcels noted in (5) above. The original of such bond(s) shall be held by an escrow agent satisfactory to the FGU, fully prepaid, at the expense of the purchaser. In the event any purchaser is a corporate or other entity, the principals of such entity must also execute full-recourse personal guarantees that assure payment of the amount(s) due under performance bonds in the event they are not honored for any reason. Compliance with the terms of the requirements hereof shall be at the sole discretion of the FGU.

{"title": "The Mancelona Tavern! Downtown Double Storefront.", "comments": "This sale includes a classic downtown double storefront building that has been used as a bar and grill in recent years (Mancelona Tavern, Bucks). There has been some poorly executed modernization done here, and there are still remnants of the classic storefront under that vinyl siding. It looks like a weathered brick fa\u00c3\u00a7ade that is hidden, and there are two recessed entryways that have been enclosed. Inside, the building is old and creaky, but generally solid. The original wood ceilings are above a late century drop ceiling of low grade. The basement had dirt floors that have partially been covered with wood. Electrical service is modern, but not of high quality workmanship. This classic downtowner could be restored with the right owner. It holds many potential uses. This sale is real estate only. We do not own the furnishings. There is no liquor license included. Just the building and land here, folks.

Most of the prep work of removing drywall, insulation and Floor Coverings has been performed on this Stick built home, This will help save on dumpster space. What we are left with seems to be a reasonably sturdy stick build home sitting on what appears to be a solid foundation. Use the existing floor plan or take advantage of the blank slate, the choice is yours. Some of the negatives can be listed as; broken windows, vandalized plumbing in the kitchen and bath, vandalized furnace, missing cabinets and walls. Home looks to currently be set as a 3 bedroom 1 bath, with separate kitchen, dining, and living spaces. Some of the windows and doors have been upgraded. Home will require much work. In the back of the home sits a larger metal sided garage complete with cement floor. This property is occupied. Please respect the privacy of current occupants and limit any inspection to what can be safely observed from the road. Some occupants may be upset or angry and may meet contact with aggression or violence. Please use discretion and caution when researching this or other occupied properties. Furthermore, although this property has been foreclosed for unpaid taxes, occupants have certain rights under Michigan law and must be formally evicted if unwilling to leave voluntarily. You may wish to consult a licensed attorney for more information. Mobile homes (and some modular homes) can be separately titled and considered personal property. In these instances, there may be third parties that have the legal right to remove that mobile home from the parcel whether or not it has been assessed as part of the property in the past. We make no representations or warranties as to whether such mobile or modular homes are included with the real property offered for sale. It is the buyer\u2019s responsibility to conduct their own research as to the state of title. As a preliminary step, it may be useful to determine if an Affidavit of Affixture of Manufactured Home has been executed and recorded as outlined in MCL 125.2330i. You may wish to consult a licensed attorney or title company to assist in this research. The previous owner of this parcel undertook a construction or rehabilitation project which has not been completed. We have attempted to describe the degree to which the project has been finished, but the building should be be considered incomplete nonetheless. The local building code enforcement official may be able to offer additional insight as to why the project was never completed. This property has been subject to vandalism by former occupants or other parties. Typical damage includes broken windows, holes in walls, broken doors and doorjambs, and other damage which can add to the cost of repair and rehabilitation.

{"title": "Occupied Home In Elberta.", "comments": "This home is in failing condition. It was occupied at the time of our inspection (May), so we did not get a close look at it, but there is much deferred maintenance obvious from the exterior. It has a large corner lot, and in addition to the house there is also a steel shop building that appears to be in use as a repair facility. We would strongly recommend that a purchaser obtain a baseline environmental assessment on this property to preclude inheriting any contamination issues from prior uses. There are numerous vehicles here. Not sure what is operable and what may be abandon. This property is occupied.

Buildings which are dangerous, occupied, boarded, condemned, or otherwise difficult to enter are inspected from the exterior/curbside only. You are NOT authorized to enter these or any other buildings offered for sale. You should limit your inspection to that which can be made safely from the building's exterior. A visual inspection of this parcel indicates potential environmental contamination.

{"title": "Square 10 Acre Parcel With Power And Buildings. Heavily Posted.", "comments": "This is a 660x660 foot \"square ten\" that sits 1/2 mile east of Tucker Road on Raspberry Lane (private road). There is an old RV and a plow truck parked at the road entrance as a point of reference. The road is washboarded and rutted from a lack of proper grading. The corner of the property at the private road is posted, as is the gated driveway. There is power here, as well as a cluster of buildings including a travel trailer and what appears to be some sort of a frame structure that resembles a portion of a modular home. We did not investigate too thoroughly out of caution due to the postings. We suggest viewing this from a distance until purchased and a full eviction has been completed. This is nicely wooded property with some hardwoods, in a peaceful setting. We have reason to believe that this property was last owned (and may still be occupied or monitored) by someone that does not recognize the right of the government to tax or foreclose upon their property. Be advised that this former owner may be potentially volatile or aggressive. We strongly advise that you limit any inspection of this property to what can be safely observed from a distance and to avoid contact with the former owner.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/98782"},

{"title": "1.18 Acre Building Site Near Torch Lake!", "comments": "This is an irregularly shaped parcel that is just a few hundred feet from Torch Lake. There is a potential view from this parcel that is heightened in the winter when the leaves are off the trees between the site and the lake. There is the remains of a burned out house here. It's roached and beyond reasonable repair. There is a well here that is probably worth rehabbing, but the rest is toast. The foundation bows in on at least two side, indicating that it is not worth reuse. This is a very nice location in an area of well maintained homes. You would do well to consider this as a building site for your northern retreat or new year round home. Our review of this parcel indicates that the noted State Equalized Value (SEV) does not appear to reflect the current value of the property. This is often due to buildings or other improvements being demolished or fire damaged or other similar items included in the SEV being removed from the property. It can also be due to market changes in the area in which the property is located. It should be further noted that the SEV/assessed value of the parcel as noted in this listing may be several years old. You should consult a local real estate professional or appraiser to help you assess the current market value of this property before bidding and should not base your valuation on the stated SEV. This parcel includes structures which have been damaged by fire. It is up to the auction purchaser to determine if this property can be restored to a safe condition and to comply with all relevant local regulations and building codes. Please research thoroughly prior to bidding.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/98780"},

However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address.

{"title": "Remote 10 Acre Campspot/hunting Camp Se Of Mancelona", "comments": "This is a horizontal 10 acre parcel, 330x1320, located in a remote setting beyond the power lines and paved roads of civilization. The gravel road here is heavily posted against trespassing, and you should exercise caution here and not veer off the proper roadway. The physical road here does not always follow the easement route, and some of the property owners here may take exception to your travelling across their lands if you are not where you should be. This parcel lies in Section 35. In order to locate it, you need to turn off the more travelled road onto a driveway/two track that lies west of it from the main trail and then veer to the right at the fork. We placed a sign on this trail. Please be aware that if you believe you are at the property and you are on a gravel road, you're a couple hundred feet too far south. Back up to the west, take the two track in, and veer to the right. This is nice wooded property, and other than the two track (which crosses the north end of the land) there are no other roads into this parcel. It has no buildings or other improvements. We placed an auction sign on it, but they have a habit of disappearing. The culture out here is backwoods, and the roads are worthy of 4WD traffic. Power is several thousand feet away. If you're looking for life off the grid, this is it. Our visual inspection indicated that electrical service was not available on or near this parcel. The nearest electric service appeared to be a considerable distance (hundreds or perhaps thousands of feet) from the property. As such, electrifying this parcel could be costly. Please conduct your own research prior to bidding.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/98707"},

Might make more sense to haul her off and bring in your newer one ... or to use it as a rental lot. The mobile here is gutted and probably beyond economic logic to rehabilitate. The value here is in the lot, well and septic. The previous owner of this parcel undertook a construction or rehabilitation project which has not been completed. We have attempted to describe the degree to which the project has been finished, but the building should be be considered incomplete nonetheless. The local building code enforcement official may be able to offer additional insight as to why the project was never completed.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/98706"},

{"title": "Handyman Special At Black Lake!", "comments": "Triple lot across the street from Black Lake ! Has a \"Biltmore\" cottage that needs help ... or perhaps removal. The cottage has mold and rot in nearly every room. The roof does not appear to be the source of most of the moisture, (there are one or two very localized leaks) so we'd theorize that it is creeping up through the concrete floor, mostly the result of being closed up for an extended period without climate control and/or a sump pump without power in the small partial crawlspace (which was inaccessible during our visit). The home is a mid-century knotty pine place, and the fairly recent onset of the moisture issue is probably a result of disuse and lack of maintenance.. It will almost certainly require a complete strip out to determine the extent of the damage to the structural framing. Fortunately, most of the home is slab-on-grade. However the kitchen area is over some form of crawlspace and its floor is very spongy and on the verge of collapse into whatever is below. Most all of the visible rot damage is in the 12 inches closest to the floor, but there is visible mold (white) on the wall surfaces in pretty much every room. This may not be past the point of gut and re-do. But it will be difficult to determine that until you actually reach that point of deconstruction. This is a triple lot, and located across the street from the sunset side of popular Black Lake ! Location, location, location !! This building contains evidence of mold. Mold is an indication of excess moisture which can come from a variety of sources including high ground water, improper sealing of foundation walls, damaged roofs, and other conditions which can be expensive to correct. Mold can pose significant health risks and, if extensive, may require a complete renovation which could exceed the value of the building.

{"title": "Restaurant Or Retail Building. Downtown Millersburg. ", "comments": "The building housed \"Alices Restaurant\" for some time, and could be returned to that use, or converted into retail or office purposes as well. Mid century construction with great exposure to the steady traffic through downtown Millersburg, just north of State Highway M-68. The property is served by natural gas, and is in generally merchantable and sound condition, tho we did notice some deferred maintenance in the eaves and soffits at the rear of the building. Prior to being a restaurant, this property was a gas station. At one point in the past there was a release here from underground storage tanks (UST) and tanks were removed from the property. It is listed on the Michigan DEQ site as \"Facility ID 00035664\". The DEQ website (see link) indicates that there are 2 tanks remaining here, but we are told they have been removed. You will want to verify this with DEQ staff if you have interest in this property. We also highly recommend obtaining a baseline environmental assessment (BEA) within 45 days of your purchase. The restaurant property is solid and merchantable. Slab on grade concrete floors, good roof, solid construction. Clean. Municipal water. Natural gas. There are two walk in coolers, a vent hood and other built-ins that are sold as fixtures attached to the property. Please remember that the \"smalls\" (contents that are not affixed) are not ours to sell. They remain the property of the last owner. The septic system here appears to be modern. You may wish to check with health department officials if you're contemplating reuse as a restaurant property. This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property. A visual inspection of this parcel indicates potential environmental contamination. Visual indicators can include things like used tires, dirty soils, or chemically intensive former uses such as dry cleaning.

{"title": "Newer Faux Log Home Near Lower Barnhart Lake!", "comments": "This one is so new that it's not even finished yet ! This is a wood frame home with log siding, across the street from Lower Barnhart Lake, east of Millersburg. The home is not complete, but may have been used for residential purposes during construction, as there are some furnishings there. It appears that the last regular occupancy may have been about 2011. It has a steel roof that shows no evidence of leaks. Some of the interior finish is original and of nice quality, but most is unfinished. The electric service, well and septic appear to be merchantable, but are not guaranteed. Unless there are hidden secrets here that we're not aware of, this one is ready for you to finish and call your own ! Great flip project !!! The previous owner of this parcel undertook a construction or rehabilitation project which has not been completed. We have attempted to describe the degree to which the project has been finished, but the building should be be considered incomplete nonetheless. The local building code enforcement official may be able to offer additional insight as to why the project was never completed.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/101968"},

{"title": "7+ Acres Near Lake Sixteen!", "comments": "Nicely wooded small acreage, a bit over 7 acres by our estimation, immediately east of Lake Sixteen. The parcel lies on both sides of the road here. The property is wooded in evergreen, oak, maple and assorted softwoods. Serene and quiet location. Great recreational property (ie: no power out here). This sits right at the foot of the Black Mountain recreation area, which is about 1/2 mile away. The legal description contains a meander line for its west boundary, which typically infers ownership to the high water mark or other edge of an adjacent waterway. In this case, that may be Lake Sixteen itself, although topographical maps show several hundred feet of marshland between the meander line and the lake. It is conceivable that you have be able to access the lake over the land in between, but that's subject to many other factors. At a minimum, there does not appear to be anything in between you and the lake, except cattails and Lilli pads. There are wetlands indicators here, mostly west of the road towards the lake. USGS topographical maps do indicate that there are marshlands on the parcel as well. There is no power or telephone on this road, and few other structures anywhere near here.

These are at the front right corner, front left eave and soffit, and the rear right corner. There are two additions to the original building, one to the rear (poor overall condition at the outer corner) and a concrete block room to the left rear that seems very solid. The floors are solid, but the front left corner (kitchen area) is wet and shows signs of decay. With a little rescue, it's probably okay. The central area of the building is dry, solid and in overall good, bvut dated, condition. We saw a HDTV accessory box here, so it has not been all that long since its last occupancy. Overall, this one can be saved. It needs a roof NOW, and the interior work can follow. It will need a new window or two, but most of the components here are merchantable.

The demolition costs have been absorbed by the county and will not be passed on to the new property owner. Our review of this parcel indicates that the noted State Equalized Value (SEV) does not appear to reflect the current value of the property. This is often due to buildings or other improvements being demolished or fire damaged or other similar items included in the SEV being removed from the property. It can also be due to market changes in the area in which the property is located. It should be further noted that the SEV/assessed value of the parcel as noted in this listing may be several years old. You should consult a local real estate professional or appraiser to help you assess the current market value of this property before bidding and should not base your valuation on the stated SEV. This parcel is located within a municipality which monitors property maintenance and condition. You may be assessed fees and fines if you fail to mow the grass or do not otherwise properly maintain the property after purchase. One advantage to these parcels is that they typically have infrastructure nearby (water, sewer, power).

Issues surrounding unimproved roads can be complicated and expensive to resolve. You should investigate the existence of any roads and the ability to access this parcel thoroughly before bidding. In some cases, a party other than the surface land owner may own the right to explore for and remove oil, natural gas, and other minerals from a property. Such \"severed\" mineral rights generally include the right to enter upon the surface of the land in order to prospect or remove minerals located beneath the surface. If you are purchasing property of any substantial size (over a few acres), you may wish to investigate whether the mineral rights are included in the sale or if they have been severed and are owned by third parties. Significant mineral interests are held by the State of Michigan. Information about mineral interests held by the State can be found here. Even if not owned by the State, mineral rights may have been sold to third parties or retained by a previous owner. Oil, gas, and other severed mineral interests are not affected by property tax foreclosure. Furthermore, due to the complicated nature of mineral abstracting, such severed interests have not been examined during the foreclosure process. Severed mineral interest are not included as part of this sale. If the mineral interests have not been severed, such interests are included.

This is a stalled rehab project that is incomplete.It appears that this was used as a duplex, and the conversion effort was amateur. There is a lot still to be done here, but the \"bones\" appear to be straight and solid. The side porch on the main floor has a bad roof, but it has not seriously impacted the rest of the structure \"yet\". The mechanicals here are incomplete and dated, tho there is a newer natural gas forced air furnace on the main level.This house is generally straight and solid, it's just in need of a complete strip out and re-do. Are you up for the challenge ? The previous owner of this parcel undertook a construction or rehabilitation project which has not been completed. We have attempted to describe the degree to which the project has been finished, but the building should be be considered incomplete nonetheless. The local building code enforcement official may be able to offer additional insight as to why the project was never completed. This one still contains substantial personal property belonging to the last owner. We did not have the opportunity to view it in detail.It is an older frame structure with newer steel roof. This building is subject to demolition if a grant, which has been applied for, is funded. Please keep in mind that the seller reserves the right to demolish this structure.If it is your intention to purchase it for rehabilitation, we'd suggest that you discuss this with the treasurers office BEFORE bidding. This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property. The structure(s) on this parcel have been slated for demolition by the local unit of government prior to sale. As such, it is being presented here as a vacant lot. You should confirm the status of this parcel as well as the allocation of the cost of demolition prior to bidding. The interior of this property was not viewed during our inspection. Buildings which are dangerous, occupied, boarded, condemned, or otherwise difficult to enter are inspected from the exterior/curbside only. You are NOT authorized to enter these or any other buildings offered for sale. You should limit your inspection to that which can be made safely from the building's exterior. Older 1.5 story home in Manistique on a 56' x 171.5' deep lot on Delta Avenue.The home is grubby and cosmetically challenged, but generally straight and sound. There are two bedrooms and a third storage type room that could be a child bedroom but has no window to meet egress code. The roof is older, but we saw no evidence of leaks. Has a newer furnace and water heater, but the electric service is as old as George Burns. This would be a good project for someone that is interested in an interior and exterior resurfacing project with \"good bones\". Insulated walls. Could use new siding and roof, tho what is here is serviceable. We did not see an entrance to the crawlspace. Home needs an interior and exterior rehab and resurface. The roof and foundation here are both sketchy, but neither have transmitted those weaknesses to the interior, \"yet\". There is a lot of rot in the eaves and soffits that has probably crept inward to the roof system.The hardwood floor is buckled, a sign of either moisture or frequently of frozen plumbing. It is missing its front porch, and the second floor is only partially completed.This home is on a list of those to potentially be demolished with grant funds that have been applied for. The seller reserves the right to demo this home whether or not it is sold. If you have interest in purchasing this home for rehab, we STRONGLY suggest that you contact the office of the County Treasurer in Manistique prior to bidding to work out details and spare it from the wrecking ball. This one has been a frequent flyer several times over the years. This time we've put it on a special list of properties to be demolished, assuming the grant application is funded. The home is boarded and needs everything. A foundation, roof, all the mechanicals (has a newer electric service, but the innards are incomplete) ... inside ... outside .... it needs everything. It probably needs a bulldozer the most of all. If you have interest in rehabbing this property, please remember that the seller is reserving the right to demolish it whether or not the grant is funded. So please contact the County Treasurers office BEFORE you bid if you have a hankering to make Weston Avenue your new address. The value here is probably in the 65x175 foot lot. One or more structures was boarded when we conducted our assessment of this parcel. Properties may be boarded for a variety of reasons. For example, properties are often boarded to prevent trespassers from harvesting copper plumbing, wiring, and other fixtures. Buildings may also be boarded by fire or other officials when they present a safety hazard. We generally do not enter boarded structures and limit our observations to the building's exterior. Likewise, you should limit any inspection of this property to its exterior only. You are not permitted to remove any boarding to view building interiors under any circumstances. Public property records or polite inquiries to neighbors may reveal additional information about a property's history.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/101595"},

{"title": "1/4 Ownership Of 12.3 Acres ", "comments": "Parcel is 406 feet north-south x 1320 feet east-west in dimension. Located on and after the curve on County Road FALL. The east half of the parcel is served by a seasonal road. This is a 1/4 undivided interest, which is shared ownership. Keep in mind that you must have consent of all owners to make physical improvements to split-ownership lands. According to USGS topographical maps, the east portion of this parcel is marshlands and the west half has some uplands and is more open. The maintained road here is rocky and can be rutted seasonally. This parcel is accessible by a road that is believed to be a seasonal or non-maintained public road. While we make no representations or warranties as to the precise nature of such road access, our research suggests that this road is either 1) Not regularly graded; and/or 2) Not snow plowed in winters; and/or 3) Appears subject to fallen trees or other events which have not been addressed by the county road commission. You should conduct your own research into this issue prior to bidding. The interest which was foreclosed and which is being offered for sale is less than a 100% ownership interest in the total parcel. Fractional ownership of real estate presents issues related to each owner's ability to use and modify the relevant property. You should thoroughly research and understand issues surrounding co-ownership of property prior to bidding. It may be wise to consult a licensed real estate attorney to answer specific questions.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/100590"},

A condominium is a form of land ownership which is divided up into individual \"units.\" Owners are required to be part of the applicable condominium association (COA) which includes rules and regulations related to the use and ownership of each unit. Additional restrictions will be spelled out in the development's master deed. Condominiums also include association fees which can be significant. Some condominium units delegate things like exterior maintenance and repair to the COA whereas the owner remains responsible for the unit's interior.

{"title": "Older 1.5 Story House In Escanaba", "comments": "NOTE: This is a \"legally non conforming duplex\" which must obtain a waiver from the city of Escanaba to function as such. The application can be viewed in the pictures in this listing. Older home that could use a coat of paint. Has had a handicap ramp added to the front porch. The porch roof has been modified and the siding there is a bit chopped up. This is \"kind of\" a duplex, but we'd check with zoning folks on whether it is legitimate. The second floor (which may not have been used in eons) has a separate exterior entrance, but it does not have a kitchen. It's not exactly clear how it originally connected to the main level, as the whole layout is a little ackward ... with the entrance to the 2nd floor being in the bathroom (?) The main floor unit is modern, clean and straight. We did notice a hump in the hardwood floor in the kitchen, but this may be from the house being closed up. We did not see any evidence of frozen plumbing that would have caused this. Hot water heat, newer boiler. Upgraded wiring. This would be a stellar property for conversion back into a single family unit.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/99530"},

The two entry doors to the home are either blocked from the inside, or the frames are bowing to the degree that if we enter, we won't be able to resecure them. So we did not enter this one.The core structure here \"looks\" straight. The roof is not bad. But it has been open to the elements (lots of broken windows and holes) and we assume there are critters living here. There is some soot/discoloration at points that infer there may have been a fire here. It will be difficult to assess the condition of this one until it has been emptied out. There is debris inside the building and all over the yard.This one is a grab bag.Nice corner lot in wells. Natural gas here. This parcel has substantial structural issues caused by poor design, insufficient maintenance, or both.

The garage is the better of the two. The mobile appears to have been vacant since about 2014. The plumbing here has frozen and the entire floor system (pressboard) sponged it up and has warped, buckled and is weak and needs pretty much a complete strip and replacement. The issue with mobiles is whether the substructure is also engineered (laminated pressboard) material. That can be the difference between a restorable unit and junk. The value here is in the land, garage, well and septic. This property contains physical indications that one or more water lines have frozen, ruptured, and leaked for a significant period of time prior to being shut off. Such indications can include damage to ceilings and floors and visibly damaged pipes and fixtures.

But based on what we saw in the upper unit, it's cluttered and dirty, but straight and solid. The home appears to be in need of a new roof, but it's tough to get a good look at it because it is surrounded by trees and brush. The upper floor of this one has a door that has been busted up, and it is inhabited by feral cats (and a couple dead ones). There is a large, 2 car garage on the alley. It also is trash filled. There is an auto in here that we have no title to. It is not included in this sale. We would summarize here by saying that this one needs to be cleaned out (and aired out), deep cleaned and resurfaced. The structure seems solid enough. It just needs attention.

You will want to access this from M-35 via Cedar 36th Lane to the north, as L Road from the south is primitive. The property has a gentle roll to it, with the front portion being open lands with a few evergreens, and the rear wooded. USGS topographical maps indicate that there is a marshland section that includes the entire rear 40 and a portion of the front one past the treeline as well. We marked the approximate SW corner of the front 40 along the road with some orange survey tape around a tree. There is the skeleton of a mobile home (aluminum stripped), a collapsed barn and an old garage building here ... all of which are in tough shape. The garage has some potential, but the other two are goners. The home is a classic old farmhouse. It has a newer block foundation underneath, but it rather Spartan inside. It has no \"bedrooms\" but there is a large living and presumably dining room on the main floor. Maple hardwood floors. The second floor is unfinished and could be a great master suite.

We came in by way of North 32 Road to the west. We found the lands in this area to be pretty much completely swamp EXCEPT for an ancient mailbox near the edge of this parcel. Traveling further, we found a spot on the parcel that actually would permit you to pull in off the road with a camper and vehicle and have sufficient room to set up camp. In mid summer, the mosquitos here would probably carry small children away. But this might make a great hunting camp in the colder months. But by the same token, there is terrific fishing in the Big Fishdam River ... and that is walking distance from this site. Our visual inspection indicated that electrical service was not available on or near this parcel. The nearest electric service appeared to be a considerable distance (hundreds or perhaps thousands of feet) from the property. As such, electrifying this parcel could be costly. Please conduct your own research prior to bidding. This parcel is accessible by a road that is believed to be a seasonal or non-maintained public road.

{"title": " Mobile Home Near Lake Michigan!", "comments": "Parcel is roughly 1/3rd of an acre, and is roughly 125x100 feet in size. Lies to the west of Highlanding Road, a private shared drive. The mobile home here is older, and is in pretty rough condition. There are a couple of apparent issues here: (1) There is an artesian well on the property (they run even without power), and it is feeding plumbing under the trailer that apparently has frozen. So it's running non-stop. (2) The private road here is not located where it is supposed to be. So \"technically\" the road is covered by trees, and the physical road is on other peoples property. The neighbor across the street claims that the property \"has no access\", however our experience is that a court would award an easement over the physical road if asked. So take that claim with a grain of salt but also be aware that there could be an argument over the topic. For what its worth, there are other properties further up this road that are allowed to pass over the \"road\" without objection. The trailer is roached. It appears that the plumbing has frozen, and there are warped floors from that. The floors are noticeably weak and it slopes at the front corner of the living room. It curiously has a dropped acoustic ceiling. It was originally two bedrooms, converted to one. Other than the artesian well issue, this is generally decent land.

This one probably needs to just be torn down. Our review of this parcel indicates that the noted State Equalized Value (SEV) does not appear to reflect the current value of the property. This is often due to buildings or other improvements being demolished or fire damaged or other similar items included in the SEV being removed from the property. It can also be due to market changes in the area in which the property is located. It should be further noted that the SEV/assessed value of the parcel as noted in this listing may be several years old. You should consult a local real estate professional or appraiser to help you assess the current market value of this property before bidding and should not base your valuation on the stated SEV.

Such indications can include damage to ceilings and floors and visibly damaged pipes and fixtures. Damage from freeze bursts can be substantial including significant harm to structural components such as framing and foundations. There is evidence posted which indicates that a lender may be attempting to foreclose upon this parcel after such parcel was foreclosed for delinquent property taxes. A purchaser may encounter future contact from this lender. Tax foreclosure supersedes the rights of mortgage holders. If a mortgage holder does not foreclose upon their mortgage interest prior to tax foreclosure, their right to do so is generally lost. Typically such mortgage holders were provided all necessary notice of tax foreclosure but failed to act in a timely fashion to preserve their interest.

{"title": "33 Foot Strip With No Road Access. Kinross.", "comments": "Parcel is 33 feet wide x 660 feet long strip that runs across the north line of the SW of the NE of the NW 1/4 of Section 34. It has little use to anyone other than the owner of adjacent lands. This parcel is what we refer to as a 33'/66'. We frequently see foreclosed parcels that are either 33 or 66 feet wide. These parcels are often a result of existing or former road rights of way. A common road right of way is 66 feet wide. Half of that is 33 feet. There are two common scenarios that we see. Scenario 1: A land owner splits a tract of land and creates a common easement parcel for access. They might then quit paying taxes on the parcel with road frontage knowing that the easement would remain even after foreclosure. Such easements are generally either 33 or 66 feet wide. Scenario 2: Rural land generally runs to the center of any public road on which it fronts whereas subdivided land usually runs to the edge of the road right-of-way. Sometimes during surveys or other splits, half of the right-of-way (usually 33 feet) can become orphaned, effectively turning to no-man's-land. Potential bidders should be aware that 33 and 66 foot wide parcels are very likely to include easements. That means that there are people who have a right to use the property even though they do not own the land. It is unlawful to cut off access over a 33 or 66 foot parcel where an easement already exists. Even if an easement doesn't already exists, courts will frequently create such an easement to prevent a neighboring parcel from becoming landlocked. Potential bidders should consider that this parcel likely has little value and cannot be used to landlock a neighboring parcel when there is no other path for ingress and egress.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/99380"},

{"title": "Waterfront Home On Lake Huron!", "comments": "This one is located just west of DeTour Village. 3 parcels (2 are small slivers at the road). Fronts 100 feet on Carlton Bay of Lake Huron near Strawberry Island. This is a nice, modern ranch style home that was occupied until early May. 2 bedrooms, one bath and an oversized 2 car garage. Woodburning fireplace. This one has some debris to move out, but it could be functional without a lot of work. The yard toward the water has an expansive view of the Lake and Strawberry Island. This is a great, quiet location and could be the family hideaway you've been waiting for !", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/99370"},
{"title": "Gas Station/party Store Property. With Owners Quarters. On M-134. Detour Area", "comments": "The Bayview Party Store/gas/deli is available for your purchase. This is a nice, modern facility with existing tanks and coolers in place. There is an attached 2 bedroom 1 bath living quarters that has a VIEW OF THE LAKE off the back deck. Also an detached utility/garage building on this parcel. This appears to have been closed since about 2008, but is in pretty good condition with no apparent roof leaks. the plumbing may have been winterized, but we can't be sure. We saw no clear signs of damage. We are also offering several other nearby properties you may want to consider for a residence if you become the operator here. Just a few miles west of DeTour Village. Property runs 250 feet along M-134 and is 400 feet deep. There is water in the basement, we presume from the power and sump pump being off. This parcel may contain buried storage tanks from previous use as a gas station or similar enterprise. Our analysis is based solely on visual inspection of the property surface as further detailed in the lot description. The State of Michigan may require a new owner to remove any remaining tanks and remediate environmental concerns at their sole expense. Additional information may be available from the MDEQ Storage Tank Database. You should conduct careful and thorough research prior to bidding on this parcel.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/99369"},
{"title": "Two 40 Acre Parcels ... Caribou Lake Area!", "comments": "Two square, adjacent 40 acre parcels are being sold as a bundle. The east 40 has marshlands over the north half or so according to USGS topographical maps, with the south half being wooded. The west 40 acre parcel appears to be mostly open lands. There is no improved road access to these parcels, and you should review real estate title records to determine easement and other legal access rights. The last Warranty Deed to this property was recorded in 1925 and is at Liber 103 Page 584, but we did not have a copy available to us to examine. We noted a trail on aerial photos that approaches the parcels from Caribou Lake Road (1320 feet to the south of the south line) but on the ground this trail is quite overgrown, rutted and muddy. Looked like a great place to get stuck in the spring weather when we were there. Be properly equipped if you go to see this in person. Great recreational, hunting and camping property !!! 80 acres in da UP can be all yours if the price is right !!! Our visual inspection indicated that electrical service was not available on or near this parcel. The nearest electric service appeared to be a considerable distance (hundreds or perhaps thousands of feet) from the property. As such, electrifying this parcel could be costly. Please conduct your own research prior to bidding. This parcel does not front on a public or privately deeded improved road. Often times there are easements in the recorded chain-of-title that provide legal access to such parcels but other times there are not. You should thoroughly research this parcel's access rights prior to bidding.

{"title": "Handyman Special Right Across The Street From Lake Huron!", "comments": "Looking for waterfront access without waterfront prices and taxes ? This property features a roofover mobile with 2 large outbuildings and sits right across the street from St Vital Bay on Lake Huron !!! Lot is 300 feet along the road and runs 200 feet deep. The home is in need of immediate help. The front porch has a severe roof leak, and the interior has molded from it. It will likely need a complete gutting and redo. There is an area in the rear roof where a tree or similar item has taken out a chunk of the soffit. The basement has standing water ... probably from a sump pump not being operable. The outbuildings are in considerably better condition, and you could conceivably convert the larger one to a residential use with some effort. The larger is roughly 24x60, and the smaller a typical 2 car garage size. Both have seemingly good roofs. There is a little debris piled in the yard. You'll become good friends with the dumpster people for a bit. Lots of potential here, folks. Bring your checkbooks. this one will be popular !!! This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property. This building contains evidence of mold. Mold is an indication of excess moisture which can come from a variety of sources including high ground water, improper sealing of foundation walls, damaged roofs, and other conditions which can be expensive to correct. Mold can pose significant health risks and, if extensive, may require a complete renovation which could exceed the value of the building. Please conduct your own research and bid accordingly.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/99366"},

The roads which are shown on plat or tax maps for this parcel do not appear to exist or may be located in a different location than shown on such maps. While a legal right to build such roads may remain, this construction would likely be very expensive. However, in some instances these unimproved roads have been vacated or abandoned by action of the local government and no such right to construct the roads remains.

The vacant corner lot is included in the sale. It seems clear that in its past, it was well maintained. However the last occupants here did a number on it before leaving. There are warped hardwood floors in the living and dining rooms from frozen plumbing, and we saw split pipes in several spots in the basement. This repairable if you're into restoration, or you could remove the hardwood and subfloor with carpet. They alsoi broke numerous windows ... once again ... a fairly straightforward repair. The roof is older, but we saw no leaks. There is some really great original wood trim hiding under several layers of white paint if you're into restoration. We suspect there is also some Victorian gingerbread trim under the aluminum siding depending on how far you want to restore it. The home has hardwood floors in many rooms. The home has 5 or more bedrooms and would house a sizeable clan. One car attached garage. The mechanicals here will likely need attention as the heat is hot water and we assume it also froze.

In these instances, there may be third parties that have the legal right to remove that mobile home from the parcel whether or not it has been assessed as part of the property in the past. We make no representations or warranties as to whether such mobile or modular homes are included with the real property offered for sale. It is the buyer\u2019s responsibility to conduct their own research as to the state of title.

{"title": "Two Story Home In Iron River", "comments": "Narrow 30x120 lot with alley service. Contains a two story home and garage in weathered condition. The home is dated, but is generally straight and solid. We would encourage a good look at the roof. It's not leaking \"yet\", but it looks pretty shady and that probably isn't far off. The electrical panel is all chopped up and the wiring is going to need an overhaul. The basement is a one room cellar, with a rear entrance. It is moist and the furnace and water heater are deteriorating because of being located here. It should be sealed better, or those units moved. The foundation was not easy to assess as it is covered in most places, and we noticed some deflection in the floors. The main floor walls have been plastered with a rough texture that would be much improved with new sheet rock. Or you could just leave it the way it is. The second floor has two bedrooms and a very oddly arranged bath tub set up that could best be described as \"cobbled\". It is enclosed in a glass walled trim piece that clearly had some other original purpose. Overall, this is a pretty basic structure that could be used as it is with some basic repairs. But it has greater potential with some cosmetic upgrades. In either instance, it's going to need a roof and mechanicals replaced in order to serve the purpose for any substantial period of time.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/99835"},
{"title": "Older Fire-Damaged Duplex In Crystal Falls!", "comments": "This is an older frame structure in Crystal Falls that needs a good deal of work. It was originally a single family home, then (not especially well) converted to a duplex. The foundation is covered, but we suspect it is a wood pier footing system and failing. The roof is old and sketchy looking. There is an exterior entrance to the second floor apartment that is showing signs of decay. Inside, the main floor walls and ceiling are covered in soot, suggesting that there has been a fire in here, or a really hazardous heating system was used. It could probably be deep cleaned (we didn't see any fire damage beyond the soot) but the house overall is of poor condition, needs a complete resurfacing inside and out, and it may or may not warrant the investment.

This parcel has substantial structural issues caused by poor design, insufficient maintenance, or both. Such buildings may be subject to condemnation orders which we were unable to locate during our inspection. All such buildings should be brought into compliance with local building regulations prior to use. We strongly recommend that you contact the local building code official and consider consulting a competent structural engineer to assess the condition of this property before to bidding.

Seems the equivalent of putting lipstick on a pig ... doesn't it ? There may be something beyond just a foundation issue here as well, as we noticed that the driveway paving is itself cracking and rolling under the house. So there could very well be something unstable under the surface here beyond the extent of the foundation walls. The land to the west is a hillside ... and this could be the result of decades of washout. There is also a one car garage here.

The house could be full of solid gold bars. We didn't look ... figured we'd let you have the first crack at the chef's surprise. The roof is older but seems straight. The foundation also looks decent. We assume there is some work to do here, or maybe you just want to remove it and start over. The lot certainly makes that worth doing. There is also a newer, half-built shed or party pavilion of some sort that is just a few feet from the edge of the river. The interior of this property was not viewed during our inspection.

You are NOT authorized to enter these or any other buildings offered for sale. You should limit your inspection to that which can be made safely from the building's exterior. One or more structures was boarded when we conducted our assessment of this parcel. Properties may be boarded for a variety of reasons. For example, properties are often boarded to prevent trespassers from harvesting copper plumbing, wiring, and other fixtures. Buildings may also be boarded by fire or other officials when they present a safety hazard. We generally do not enter boarded structures and limit our observations to the building's exterior. Likewise, you should limit any inspection of this property to its exterior only. You are not permitted to remove any boarding to view building interiors under any circumstances.

At this time the basement of this building is FULL (yews we mean full) of water that is probably at least 5 or 6 feet deep. There has been some molding and a buyer will really need to strip it down to the bare elements and resurface. Much of the construction here is masonry, so recovery should not be much more than sealing and surfacing. We assume the water is the result of a de-powered sump pump, but there is also a minor roof leak in the center of the roof from a roof drain that likely froze up. This could be a really great office property. Because the building is fairly small (less than 1000 square feet or so) the cost of renovation would be quite reasonable. This building contains evidence of mold. Mold is an indication of excess moisture which can come from a variety of sources including high ground water, improper sealing of foundation walls, damaged roofs, and other conditions which can be expensive to correct. Mold can pose significant health risks and, if extensive, may require a complete renovation which could exceed the value of the building.

The property east of the road is wooded heavily and rises a few feet. The property west of the road (which is the predominate portion of the acreage) is very level, and mostly open. This is tillable land. The soils here are well drained and very suitable for building. A small creek traverses the property and is a tributary to the Otter River, which flows nearby. The farmhouse here is older, but very serviceable. It has a newer steel roof, and the mechanicals are a little crude, but we expect that they serve their purpose. There are signs that this house has been used within the last year. It seems pretty evident that there are issues with the well and septic here, as there is an open pit to the rear that sewage lines appear to discharge into. But the cost of replacing these system is well worth the investment given the potential this property has as a getaway or retreat. This is some fabulous land, in a very secluded location. There are likely entire days that go by without traffic on this stretch of road. If you're looking for an escape, this is it !", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/99684"},

{"title": "1.5 Story Home In Ironwood.", "comments": "A great little 1.5 story home. The attached one car garage is in pretty rough shape and features open air design. It probably just needs to be torn off. It's shot. Inside, this is a pleasant home with hardwood floors worth refinishing. However there is a substantial slope in the floor toward the center of the home, and some large (up to 1/2\") cracks are visible in walls and corners, especially the stairway leading to the three upstairs bedrooms. Clearly, something is amiss underneath this one and should be immediately corrected. However the access to the basement is (you guessed it) buried in the rubble out in the garage. So this one is Chef's surprise ... it could be as simple as jacking up and stabilizing it, or as complicated as a structural failure. We can't be certain. This could be a cute little place. But it will take some clean up to get there. This parcel has substantial structural issues caused by poor design, insufficient maintenance, or both.

Inside, there are a couple dozen office sized rooms along a corridor that circles around the building (see diagram in photos). There is also a corner space that was rented out in the past to a sporting goods store. Building notes indicate that the walls inside are sound reducing panels. We believe they can be removed with minimal effort. The building has a substantial single phase, 600 amp power service and is wired for telco and cat5 paths. Two gas and power services. Barrier free design. HVAC is rooftop units. Would make an excellent governmental, corporate or shared rental facility. We noticed mold starting on the walls of one interior room.

This mobile home may be beyond saving. It is possible that you could pull the entire floor and subfloor out of it and redo, but if the substructure is engineered (laminated chipboard) and if that has been soaked as well, it might be a real crap shoot (local pun intended) depending on how long the water ran before being shut off.

Mold is an indication of excess moisture which can come from a variety of sources including high ground water, improper sealing of foundation walls, damaged roofs, and other conditions which can be expensive to correct.

{"title": "Bundle", "comments": "ATTN: No online bidding for this lot. The parcels in this sale unit are grouped, (\"bundled\") as permitted by MCL 211.78m. Many of these include structures which contain lead based paint. Some may contain asbestos. Many are in various stages of disrepair or collapse and are considered dangerous buildings and attractive nuisance. Some may be occupied by tenants-holding-over under law. These parcels are not being offered individually. They must be purchased as a single bundle at or above the minimum bid price, if any is stated. Pursuant to MCL 211.78 (1), the Foreclosing Governmental Unit (FGU) has determined that the most efficient and expeditious method to return many of these parcels to productive use, is to require their immediate demolition, remediation, rehabilitation or repurposing if sold at auction. Many of these parcels constitute blight, a public nuisance and abatement is considered necessary. Before their sale to ANY purchaser at auction, it is the intent of the FGU that any such purchaser shall demonstrate their financial ability and willingness to perform those actions necessary, in the public interest and welfare, to bring the properties into compliance with local codes and ordinances. Therefore, it is a further requirement of sale of the bundled properties that a purchaser must demolish, remediate, rehabilitate or repurpose these properties as follows: 1) ALL STRUCTURES must be secured and made un-enterable within 15 days of sale at auction, at the purchasers sole expense, or the sale shall be cancelled and no refund or deed issued. 2) Any visible refuse, garbage, trash or other cast off shall be removed from lands within 15 days of the sale at auction, at the purchasers sole expense, or the sale shall be cancelled and no refund or deed issued.. 3) The conditions required in (1) and (2) above shall be maintained against further entry or blight for a period of 12 months following the execution of a deed. 4) Those properties in the bundle that are beyond reasonable repair or economic vitality to repair must be demolished at the sole expense of the purchaser. The cost of such work shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. All such demolition must be performed within 6 months of deeding, by a licensed, insured demolition contractor acceptable to the code official of the local unit of government where the property is located. All proper permits for demolition and the removal and disposal of volatile debris (asbestos, contaminants etc) must be obtained. 5) Those properties in the bundle which appear to either the purchaser, FGU or the code enforcement official of the local unit of government to be potentially contaminated, shall be the subject of a Baseline Environmental Assessment (BEA) at the sole expense of the purchaser. The cost of such BEA(s) shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. The BEA(s) shall be conducted by an insured environmental consultant licensed in the State of Michigan within 45 days of purchase, and shall be fully complete and filed with the proper authorities within 90 days of purchase. The level of the BEA to be conducted shall be determined by the findings of the initial phase(s) of the BEA at each parcel subject to such study. Where contamination is evident, the purchaser shall indemnify the FGU with a separate performance bond (issued on the same terms as others herein required) in an amount equal to the full cost of remediation of the contamination at each such site, and for a period of twenty (20) years, unless remediation is undertaken and completed during that time period. If the site is remediated to a level satisfactory to state officials charged with such determinations, the requirement for a performance bond shall be removed for that site. 6) Those properties in the bundle which can be rehabilitated or repurposed shall be brought into compliance with all construction, occupancy, zoning and other use codes of the local unit of government within 12 months. Construction and/or mechanical permits must be obtained prior to performing such work. Occupancy permits must be obtained by the expiration of that term. All construction and rehabilitation work at these properties shall be carried out by contractors that are licensed and insured, and acceptable to the code enforcement officer of the local unit of government. The cost of such work shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. In pursuance of those requirements and their costs and timelines, the FGU is requiring the posting of a performance bond in the amount of $450,000.00. The performance bond shall be made out in favor of the Office of the Bay County Treasurer (acting as the Foreclosing Governmental Unit). Evidence of the issuance and full payment for such bond shall be presented to the FGU within fifteen (15) days of the acceptance of the purchasers bid at auction. In the event evidence of issuance and full payment is not tendered within fifteen (15) days of sale, the sale shall be cancelled outright, and the purchaser considered non-responsive to a necessary condition of the sale.

{"title": "Bundle", "comments": "The parcels in this sale unit are grouped, (\"bundled\") as permitted by MCL 211.78m. Many of these include structures which contain lead based paint. Some may contain asbestos. Many are in various stages of disrepair or collapse and are considered dangerous buildings and attractive nuisance. Some may be occupied by tenants-holding-over under law. These parcels are not being offered individually. They must be purchased as a single bundle at or above the minimum bid price, if any is stated. Pursuant to MCL 211.78 (1), the Foreclosing Governmental Unit (FGU) has determined that the most efficient and expeditious method to return many of these parcels to productive use, is to require their immediate demolition, remediation, rehabilitation or repurposing if sold at auction. Many of these parcels constitute blight, a public nuisance and abatement is considered necessary. Before their sale to ANY purchaser at auction, it is the intent of the FGU that any such purchaser shall demonstrate their financial ability and willingness to perform those actions necessary, in the public interest and welfare, to bring the properties into compliance with local codes and ordinances. Therefore, it is a further requirement of sale of the bundled properties that a purchaser must demolish, remediate, rehabilitate or repurpose these properties as follows: 1) ALL STRUCTURES must be secured and made un-enterable within 15 days of sale at auction, at the purchasers sole expense, or the sale shall be cancelled and no refund or deed issued. 2) Any visible refuse, garbage, trash or other cast off shall be removed from lands within 15 days of the sale at auction, at the purchasers sole expense, or the sale shall be cancelled and no refund or deed issued.. 3) The conditions required in (1) and (2) above shall be maintained against further entry or blight for a period of 12 months following the execution of a deed. 4) Those properties in the bundle that are beyond reasonable repair or economic vitality to repair must be demolished at the sole expense of the purchaser. The cost of such work shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. All such demolition must be performed within 6 months of deeding, by a licensed, insured demolition contractor acceptable to the code official of the local unit of government where the property is located. All proper permits for demolition and the removal and disposal of volatile debris (asbestos, contaminants etc) must be obtained. 5) Those properties in the bundle which appear to either the purchaser, FGU or the code enforcement official of the local unit of government to be potentially contaminated, shall be the subject of a Baseline Environmental Assessment (BEA) at the sole expense of the purchaser. The cost of such BEA(s) shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. The BEA(s) shall be conducted by an insured environmental consultant licensed in the State of Michigan within 45 days of purchase, and shall be fully complete and filed with the proper authorities within 90 days of purchase. The level of the BEA to be conducted shall be determined by the findings of the initial phase(s) of the BEA at each parcel subject to such study. Where contamination is evident, the purchaser shall indemnify the FGU with a separate performance bond (issued on the same terms as others herein required) in an amount equal to the full cost of remediation of the contamination at each such site, and for a period of twenty (20) years, unless remediation is undertaken and completed during that time period. If the site is remediated to a level satisfactory to state officials charged with such determinations, the requirement for a performance bond shall be removed for that site. 6) Those properties in the bundle which can be rehabilitated or repurposed shall be brought into compliance with all construction, occupancy, zoning and other use codes of the local unit of government within 12 months. Construction and/or mechanical permits must be obtained prior to performing such work. Occupancy permits must be obtained by the expiration of that term. All construction and rehabilitation work at these properties shall be carried out by contractors that are licensed and insured, and acceptable to the code enforcement officer of the local unit of government. The cost of such work shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. In pursuance of those requirements and their costs and timelines, the FGU is requiring the posting of a performance bond in the amount of $1,500,000.00. The performance bond shall be made out in favor of the Office of the Kalamazoo County Treasurer (acting as the Foreclosing Governmental Unit). Evidence of the issuance and full payment for such bond shall be presented to the FGU within fifteen (15) days of the acceptance of the purchasers bid at auction. In the event evidence of issuance and full payment is not tendered within fifteen (15) days of sale, the sale shall be cancelled outright, and the purchaser considered non-responsive to a necessary condition of the sale. No receipt for the sale shall be issued, and the bidder shall not be entitled to enter upon such premises, until such bond is issued and deemed sufficient by the FGU. Such bond shall be issued by an underwriter licensed to do business in the State of Michigan, who is not the subject of any pending disciplinary action by the State of Michigan or any department, bureau or commission thereof. It shall be payable, in full amount, to the FGU in the event of either whole or partial non-performance of the terms above written for its entire duration. It shall run as effective and be fully pre-paid, for the entire term of twenty-four (24) months. Any overage or refund shall be payable to the purchaser upon earlier termination of the bond because of full performance hereunder. This 24 month time period is not applicable to those performance bonds required for contaminated parcels noted in (5) above. The original of such bond(s) shall be held by an escrow agent satisfactory to the FGU, fully prepaid, at the expense of the purchaser. In the event any purchaser is a corporate or other entity, the principals of such entity must also execute full-recourse personal guarantees that assure payment of the amount(s) due under performance bonds in the event they are not honored for any reason. Compliance with the terms of the requirements hereof shall be at the sole discretion of the FGU. 2 story home. Shingled roof. Concrete driveway. Fenced in yard. Last visit this home was occupied.

This parcel is likely subject to ASSOCIATION FEES which are assessed to cover maintenance and other costs associated with the development in which the parcel is located. Interested parties should verify the existence and extent of association fees and costs prior to bidding. This lot is part of a condominium development. A condominium is a form of land ownership which is divided up into individual \"units.\" Owners are required to be part of the applicable condominium association (COA) which includes rules and regulations related to the use and ownership of each unit. Additional restrictions will be spelled out in the development's master deed. Condominiums also include association fees which can be significant. Some condominium units delegate things like exterior maintenance and repair to the COA whereas the owner remains responsible for the unit's interior. However, there are many varieties of condominiums including residential and commercial interior space, condo subdivision lots, condo boat slips, condo campsites and others. Prospective bidders should carefully review and understand the master deed, COA rules and regulations, and investigate association fees prior to bidding.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/100096"},

{"title": "Second Round Bundle", "comments": "The parcels in this sale unit are grouped, (\"bundled\") as permitted by MCL 211.78m. Many of these include structures which contain lead based paint. Some may contain asbestos. Many are in various stages of disrepair or collapse and are considered dangerous buildings and attractive nuisance. Some may be occupied by tenants-holding-over under law. These parcels are not being offered individually. They must be purchased as a single bundle at or above the minimum bid price, if any is stated. Pursuant to MCL 211.78 (1), the Foreclosing Governmental Unit (FGU) has determined that the most efficient and expeditious method to return many of these parcels to productive use, is to require their immediate demolition, remediation, rehabilitation or repurposing if sold at auction. Many of these parcels constitute blight, a public nuisance and abatement is considered necessary. Before their sale to ANY purchaser at auction, it is the intent of the FGU that any such purchaser shall demonstrate their financial ability and willingness to perform those actions necessary, in the public interest and welfare, to bring the properties into compliance with local codes and ordinances. Therefore, it is a further requirement of sale of the bundled properties that a purchaser must demolish, remediate, rehabilitate or repurpose these properties as follows: 1) ALL STRUCTURES must be secured and made un-enterable within 15 days of sale at auction, at the purchasers sole expense, or the sale shall be cancelled and no refund or deed issued. 2) Any visible refuse, garbage, trash or other cast off shall be removed from lands within 15 days of the sale at auction, at the purchasers sole expense, or the sale shall be cancelled and no refund or deed issued.. 3) The conditions required in (1) and (2) above shall be maintained against further entry or blight for a period of 12 months following the execution of a deed. 4) Those properties in the bundle that are beyond reasonable repair or economic vitality to repair must be demolished at the sole expense of the purchaser. The cost of such work shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. All such demolition must be performed within 6 months of deeding, by a licensed, insured demolition contractor acceptable to the code official of the local unit of government where the property is located. All proper permits for demolition and the removal and disposal of volatile debris (asbestos, contaminants etc) must be obtained. 5) Those properties in the bundle which appear to either the purchaser, FGU or the code enforcement official of the local unit of government to be potentially contaminated, shall be the subject of a Baseline Environmental Assessment (BEA) at the sole expense of the purchaser. The cost of such BEA(s) shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. The BEA(s) shall be conducted by an insured environmental consultant licensed in the State of Michigan within 45 days of purchase, and shall be fully complete and filed with the proper authorities within 90 days of purchase. The level of the BEA to be conducted shall be determined by the findings of the initial phase(s) of the BEA at each parcel subject to such study. Where contamination is evident, the purchaser shall indemnify the FGU with a separate performance bond (issued on the same terms as others herein required) in an amount equal to the full cost of remediation of the contamination at each such site, and for a period of twenty (20) years, unless remediation is undertaken and completed during that time period. If the site is remediated to a level satisfactory to state officials charged with such determinations, the requirement for a performance bond shall be removed for that site. 6) Those properties in the bundle which can be rehabilitated or repurposed shall be brought into compliance with all construction, occupancy, zoning and other use codes of the local unit of government within 12 months. Construction and/or mechanical permits must be obtained prior to performing such work. Occupancy permits must be obtained by the expiration of that term. All construction and rehabilitation work at these properties shall be carried out by contractors that are licensed and insured, and acceptable to the code enforcement officer of the local unit of government. The cost of such work shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. In pursuance of those requirements and their costs and timelines, the FGU is requiring the posting of a performance bond in the amount of $1,500,000.00. The performance bond shall be made out in favor of the Office of the Jackson County Treasurer (acting as the Foreclosing Governmental Unit). Evidence of the issuance and full payment for such bond shall be presented to the FGU within fifteen (15) days of the acceptance of the purchasers bid at auction. In the event evidence of issuance and full payment is not tendered within fifteen (15) days of sale, the sale shall be cancelled outright, and the purchaser considered non-responsive to a necessary condition of the sale. No receipt for the sale shall be issued, and the bidder shall not be entitled to enter upon such premises, until such bond is issued and deemed sufficient by the FGU. Such bond shall be issued by an underwriter licensed to do business in the State of Michigan, who is not the subject of any pending disciplinary action by the State of Michigan or any department, bureau or commission thereof. It shall be payable, in full amount, to the FGU in the event of either whole or partial non-performance of the terms above written for its entire duration. It shall run as effective and be fully pre-paid, for the entire term of twenty-four (24) months. Any overage or refund shall be payable to the purchaser upon earlier termination of the bond because of full performance hereunder. This 24 month time period is not applicable to those performance bonds required for contaminated parcels noted in (5) above. The original of such bond(s) shall be held by an escrow agent satisfactory to the FGU, fully prepaid, at the expense of the purchaser. In the event any purchaser is a corporate or other entity, the principals of such entity must also execute full-recourse personal guarantees that assure payment of the amount(s) due under performance bonds in the event they are not honored for any reason. Compliance with the terms of the requirements hereof shall be at the sole discretion of the FGU. 3", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/99849"},

This parcel has been posted as \"Condemned\" by the local building authority. Properties are generally condemned when they are deemed substandard, unsafe, or otherwise unfit for use and habitation.

Without this, the sale will be canceled and no deeds will be issued. Please be aware before bidding* This building contains evidence of mold. Mold is an indication of excess moisture which can come from a variety of sources including high ground water, improper sealing of foundation walls, damaged roofs, and other conditions which can be expensive to correct. Mold can pose significant health risks and, if extensive, may require a complete renovation which could exceed the value of the building. Please conduct your own research and bid accordingly. One or more buildings on this parcel has a roof which is either leaking to the interior or appears close to failure. Failing roofs often indicate substantial structural decay inside the building. You should investigate the integrity of this structure(s) prior to bidding. This parcel appears to have been subject to harvesting of electrical, plumbing, mechanical systems, or other building components. Buildings are sometimes targeted by criminals that steal or \"harvest\" items such as copper plumbing, wiring, furnaces, water heaters, fixtures, hardwood flooring, etc. This building should be considered incomplete due to such harvesting and may require substantial investment to reequip. The foundation of one or more buildings located on this parcel appears to be failing. Correcting foundation issues can be very expensive and issues are often more complex than they initially appear. You should research this issue thoroughly prior to bidding on this parcel. This parcel has substantial structural issues caused by poor design, insufficient maintenance, or both. Such buildings may be subject to condemnation orders which we were unable to locate during our inspection. All such buildings should be brought into compliance with local building regulations prior to use. We strongly recommend that you contact the local building code official and consider consulting a competent structural engineer to assess the condition of this property before to bidding. This parcel includes a structure which should be considered DANGEROUS. This building has suffered structural damage which creates substantial risk of harm from falling through damaged areas or collapse from above. It may also contain extensive debris which could fall or collapse, rusty nails, broken glass, and other hazards. You are not permitted to enter this or any other structure offered at tax sale.

{"title": "3' Wide Strip Of Land In Lake City Neighborhood ", "comments": "Neighboring friendly neighbors, this property is the South 3' of the neighbor to the North. Neighbor is currently using the land for gardening. This parcel is located within a municipality which monitors property maintenance and condition. You may be assessed fees and fines if you fail to mow the grass or do not otherwise properly maintain the property after purchase. One advantage to these parcels is that they typically have infrastructure nearby (water, sewer, power). However, you should confirm the availability of such utilities as well as the connection costs prior to bidding. It is your responsibility to determine whether a parcel is suitable for your desired purpose. This parcel is too small to be practically useful under most circumstances. Many times such parcels are the result of survey or property transfer errors which create small orphaned slivers of land. These parcels are frequently too small to allow construction or any other practical use. They often have no road frontage or legal means of access. These parcels can often lead to adverse claims or encroachments by neighboring land owners which can be complicated legal issues to resolve. Please investigate this parcel thoroughly prior to bidding.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/100715"},

This home looks to be well cared for but still may need some work. Also, this home had a close call with fallen trees! The lucky horse shoes may have played a part. Mobile homes (and some modular homes) can be separately titled and considered personal property. In these instances, there may be third parties that have the legal right to remove that mobile home from the parcel whether or not it has been assessed as part of the property in the past. We make no representations or warranties as to whether such mobile or modular homes are included with the real property offered for sale. It is the buyer\u2019s responsibility to conduct their own research as to the state of title. As a preliminary step, it may be useful to determine if an Affidavit of Affixture of Manufactured Home has been executed and recorded as outlined in MCL 125.2330i. You may wish to consult a licensed attorney or title company to assist in this research. This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value.
