This parcel is located within a municipality which monitors property maintenance and condition. You may be assessed fees and fines if you fail to mow the grass or do not otherwise properly maintain the property after purchase.

{"title": "Good Location In Town ", "comments": "Note: This property is zoned strictly for commercial use only. Newer well manufactured home on 2 lots. Very clean condition on the inside . There is evidence posted which indicates that a lender may be attempting to foreclose upon this parcel after such parcel was foreclosed for delinquent property taxes. A purchaser may encounter future contact from this lender. Tax foreclosure supersedes the rights of mortgage holders. If a mortgage holder does not foreclose upon their mortgage interest prior to tax foreclosure, their right to do so is generally lost. Typically such mortgage holders were provided all necessary notice of tax foreclosure but failed to act in a timely fashion to preserve their interest. In rare instances it may be necessary to cancel a sale if a deficiency in notice to such a lender is discovered. Please contact us or ask questions at the sale if you have concerns about this issue.

However, in some instances these unimproved roads have been vacated or abandoned by action of the local government and no such right to construct the roads remains. Issues surrounding unimproved roads can be complicated and expensive to resolve. You should investigate the existence of any roads and the ability to access this parcel thoroughly before bidding.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/119353"},

{"title": "Bundle", "comments": "The parcels in this sale unit are grouped, (\"bundled\") as permitted by MCL 211.78m. Many of these include structures which contain lead based paint. Some may contain asbestos. Many are in various stages of disrepair or collapse and are considered dangerous buildings and attractive nuisance. Some may be occupied by tenants-holding-over under law. These parcels are not being offered individually. They must be purchased as a single bundle at or above the minimum bid price, if any is stated. Pursuant to MCL 211.78 (1), the Foreclosing Governmental Unit (FGU) has determined that the most efficient and expeditious method to return many of these parcels to productive use, is to require their immediate demolition, remediation, rehabilitation or repurposing if sold at auction. Many of these parcels constitute blight, a public nuisance and abatement is considered necessary. Before their sale to ANY purchaser at auction, it is the intent of the FGU that any such purchaser shall demonstrate their financial ability and willingness to perform those actions necessary, in the public interest and welfare, to bring the properties into compliance with local codes and ordinances. Therefore, it is a further requirement of sale of the bundled properties that a purchaser must demolish, remediate, rehabilitate or repurpose these properties as follows: 1) ALL STRUCTURES must be secured and made un-enterable within 15 days of sale at auction, at the purchasers sole expense, or the sale shall be cancelled and no refund or deed issued. 2) Any visible refuse, garbage, trash or other cast off shall be removed from lands within 15 days of the sale at auction, at the purchasers sole expense, or the sale shall be cancelled and no refund or deed issued.. 3) The conditions required in (1) and (2) above shall be maintained against further entry or blight for a period of 12 months following the execution of a deed. 4) Those properties in the bundle that are beyond reasonable repair or economic vitality to repair must be demolished at the sole expense of the purchaser. The cost of such work shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. All such demolition must be performed within 6 months of deeding, by a licensed, insured demolition contractor acceptable to the code official of the local unit of government where the property is located. All proper permits for demolition and the removal and disposal of volatile debris (asbestos, contaminants etc) must be obtained. 5) Those properties in the bundle which appear to either the purchaser, FGU or the code enforcement official of the local unit of government to be potentially contaminated, shall be the subject of a Baseline Environmental Assessment (BEA) at the sole expense of the purchaser. The cost of such BEA(s) shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. The BEA(s) shall be conducted by an insured environmental consultant licensed in the State of Michigan within 45 days of purchase, and shall be fully complete and filed with the proper authorities within 90 days of purchase. The level of the BEA to be conducted shall be determined by the findings of the initial phase(s) of the BEA at each parcel subject to such study. Where contamination is evident, the purchaser shall indemnify the FGU with a separate performance bond (issued on the same terms as others herein required) in an amount equal to the full cost of remediation of the contamination at each such site, and for a period of twenty (20) years, unless remediation is undertaken and completed during that time period. If the site is remediated to a level satisfactory to state officials charged with such determinations, the requirement for a performance bond shall be removed for that site. 6) Those properties in the bundle which can be rehabilitated or repurposed shall be brought into compliance with all construction, occupancy, zoning and other use codes of the local unit of government within 12 months. Construction and/or mechanical permits must be obtained prior to performing such work. Occupancy permits must be obtained by the expiration of that term. All construction and rehabilitation work at these properties shall be carried out by contractors that are licensed and insured, and acceptable to the code enforcement officer of the local unit of government. The cost of such work shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. In pursuance of those requirements and their costs and timelines, the FGU is requiring the posting of a performance bond in the amount of $1,000,000.00. The performance bond shall be made out in favor of the Office of the Kalamazoo County Treasurer (acting as the Foreclosing Governmental Unit). Evidence of the issuance and full payment for such bond shall be presented to the FGU within fifteen (15) days of the acceptance of the purchasers bid at auction. In the event evidence of issuance and full payment is not tendered within fifteen (15) days of sale, the sale shall be cancelled outright, and the purchaser considered non-responsive to a necessary condition of the sale. No receipt for the sale shall be issued, and the bidder shall not be entitled to enter upon such premises, until such bond is issued and deemed sufficient by the FGU. Such bond shall be issued by an underwriter licensed to do business in the State of Michigan, who is not the subject of any pending disciplinary action by the State of Michigan or any department, bureau or commission thereof. It shall be payable, in full amount, to the FGU in the event of either whole or partial non-performance of the terms above written for its entire duration. It shall run as effective and be fully pre-paid, for the entire term of twenty-four (24) months. Any overage or refund shall be payable to the purchaser upon earlier termination of the bond because of full performance hereunder. This 24 month time period is not applicable to those performance bonds required for contaminated parcels noted in (5) above. The original of such bond(s) shall be held by an escrow agent satisfactory to the FGU, fully prepaid, at the expense of the purchaser. In the event any purchaser is a corporate or other entity, the principals of such entity must also execute full-recourse personal guarantees that assure payment of the amount(s) due under performance bonds in the event they are not honored for any reason. Compliance with the terms of the requirements hereof shall be at the sole discretion of the FGU.

This parcel has been posted as \"Condemned\" by the local building authority. Properties are generally condemned when they are deemed substandard, unsafe, or otherwise unfit for use and habitation. Condemned property must be rehabilitated to meet local building codes prior to use or occupancy. A building is not automatically slated for demolition when condemned. However, this does not necessarily mean that demolition will not also be pursued by the local unit.

With the foundation put back in place, much of the work here would be done, leaving the second floor to finish off as you desire. UPPCO has dropped power service here. If you held an interest in this parcel prior to foreclosure and wish to buy it back, you are required by law to pay at least the minimum bid which was placed on the property during the first round auction. You are not eligible to purchase this property for the lower \"no reserve\" amount offered at this second round sale. The minimum bid includes all delinquent taxes, interest, penalties, and fees that were due on the property at the time of foreclosure. See MCL 211.78m(5) for more information. The previous owner of this parcel undertook a construction or rehabilitation project which has not been completed. We have attempted to describe the degree to which the project has been finished, but the building should be be considered incomplete nonetheless. The local building code enforcement official may be able to offer additional insight as to why the project was never completed. The foundation of one or more buildings located on this parcel appears to be failing. Correcting foundation issues can be very expensive and issues are often more complex than they initially appear. You should research this issue thoroughly prior to bidding on this parcel.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/119440"},

You are not eligible to purchase this property for the lower \"no reserve\" amount offered at this second round sale. The minimum bid includes all delinquent taxes, interest, penalties, and fees that were due on the property at the time of foreclosure. See MCL 211.78m(5) for more information. This parcel is what we refer to as a 33'/66'. We frequently see foreclosed parcels that are either 33 or 66 feet wide. These parcels are often a result of existing or former road rights of way. A common road right of way is 66 feet wide. Half of that is 33 feet. There are two common scenarios that we see. Scenario 1: A land owner splits a tract of land and creates a common easement parcel for access. They might then quit paying taxes on the parcel with road frontage knowing that the easement would remain even after foreclosure. Such easements are generally either 33 or 66 feet wide. Scenario 2: Rural land generally runs to the center of any public road on which it fronts whereas subdivided land usually runs to the edge of the road right-of-way. Sometimes during surveys or other splits, half of the right-of-way (usually 33 feet) can become orphaned, effectively turning to no-man's-land. Potential bidders should be aware that 33 and 66 foot wide parcels are very likely to include easements. That means that there are people who have a right to use the property even though they do not own the land. It is unlawful to cut off access over a 33 or 66 foot parcel where an easement already exists. Even if an easement doesn't already exists, courts will frequently create such an easement to prevent a neighboring parcel from becoming landlocked. Potential bidders should consider that this parcel likely has little value and cannot be used to landlock a neighboring parcel when there is no other path for ingress and egress.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/119404"},

This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property. This property is occupied. Please respect the privacy of current occupants and limit any inspection to what can be safely observed from the road. Some occupants may be upset or angry and may meet contact with aggression or violence. Please use discretion and caution when researching this or other occupied properties. Furthermore, although this property has been foreclosed for unpaid taxes, occupants have certain rights under Michigan law and must be formally evicted if unwilling to leave voluntarily. You may wish to consult a licensed attorney for more information. The interior of this property was not viewed during our inspection. Buildings which are dangerous, occupied, boarded, condemned, or otherwise difficult to enter are inspected from the exterior/curbside only. You are NOT authorized to enter these or any other buildings offered for sale. You should limit your inspection to that which can be made safely from the building's exterior.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/119351"},

One is a nearly move-in ready home, and the other was probably commercial at one time and needs to be demolished. The home is clean. straight and could be one of the most \"ready to use\" homes in the Houghton County sale this year. It is a modified 4-square design featuring three bedrooms and a bath up, and a full basement with interior and exterior entrances. It has great attic access for extra storage or development. The furnace and water heater are merchantable, though the water heater has odd damage to the jacket which we have not seen before and does not appear to be freeze damage. This home has been well maintained for many years and has little to be done other than decor change as an option. The roof is older but serviceable. The basement walls could stand a coat of thoroseal, but they're solid. Building number two, on the other hand, needs to come down. The rear portion has collapsed, access to the second floor is treacherous, and we did not examine it closely because it's just simply a basket case and needs to go. It is separately described. There is also a full, vacant lot to the west that serves as access and parking for the home. This tax parcel ID and SEV is for the vacant lot.

Such demolition and remediation shall be completed within six months of the date of the auction. Demolition shall be considered complete upon certification of seller and at seller's sole discretion. The Surety shall be applied to the costs of demolition and remediation in accordance with the approved plan. Any costs incurred over and above the Surety are the sole responsibility of purchaser. Any Surety which remains after seller certifies the satisfactory completion of all demolition and remediation activities shall be returned to purchaser.

Our review of this parcel indicates that the noted State Equalized Value (SEV) does not appear to reflect the current value of the property. This is often due to buildings or other improvements being demolished or fire damaged or other similar items included in the SEV being removed from the property. It can also be due to market changes in the area in which the property is located. It should be further noted that the SEV/assessed value of the parcel as noted in this listing may be several years old. You should consult a local real estate professional or appraiser to help you assess the current market value of this property before bidding and should not base your valuation on the stated SEV.

We've had this one a couple of times before when it was occupied. This time it's vacant, and it's condemned. We're told by locals that there is high water table here, and the USGS topo maps certainly reinforce that by indicating there is swamp right out back. The Presque Isle River is just a couple hundred feet to the east. The condemnation is probably from a combination of a bad roof and we assume that the septic system here probably is waterlogged part of the year and needs redesign. Curiously, there is very little interior damage from the roof. The house seems fairly straight and solid other than weak floors in the back porch entry. It does have potential if one were to re-roof it (which will require some replacement of eave materials as well) and a new septic most likely. It IS condemned, so contact the village code enforcement people (probably the county building inspector) and make sure you know what you're dealing with before bidding.

In its more recent incarnation, it has been mostly a transient housing and monthly rental debacle mixed with full-time residency. Not much \"resort\" traffic here in some time. In the original design, this was a mini-resort of 50ish hotel type rooms and mini-townhouses, with several bars, food service operations and an indoor pool, in close proximity (but independent of) the nearby Big Powderhorn Mountain ski operations. The pool, bars and food service have not been open for business in many years on a regular basis. There is no liquor license currently associated with this property, and most of the rooms that are included in this offering are vacant and need work. There are roughly 54 residential units in this property, and we are offering 25 PLUS the \"core\" unit which comprises the bar, food service and recreational areas of the building as a single package. We are offering 15 main floor units, 7 second floor (cathedral ceiling) units, and the \"core\" food and beverage units. For general reference, please see : https://powdermillresort.blogspot.com/ Be aware that there is a dedicated community that individually own the remaining units here, many of whom have been doggedly pursuing POA duties and goals for many years. In addition to association fees for maintenance of the property, these units are also subject to a SPECIAL ASSESSMENT for a water/sewer district improvement. AS A CONDITION OF SALE, the seller is requiring the purchaser to pay the entire balance of the special assessment ($21,142.40) for all units being sold IN FULL prior to issuing a deed. This amount is included in the tax amount listed on this lot.

There is evidence posted which indicates that a lender may be attempting to foreclose upon this parcel after such parcel was foreclosed for delinquent property taxes. A purchaser may encounter future contact from this lender. Tax foreclosure supersedes the rights of mortgage holders. If a mortgage holder does not foreclose upon their mortgage interest prior to tax foreclosure, their right to do so is generally lost. Typically such mortgage holders were provided all necessary notice of tax foreclosure but failed to act in a timely fashion to preserve their interest. In rare instances it may be necessary to cancel a sale if a deficiency in notice to such a lender is discovered. Please contact us or ask questions at the sale if you have concerns about this issue.

Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property. The previous owner of this parcel undertook a construction or rehabilitation project which has not been completed.

This parcel may contain buried storage tanks from previous use as a gas station or similar enterprise. Our analysis is based solely on visual inspection of the property surface as further detailed in the lot description. The State of Michigan may require a new owner to remove any remaining tanks and remediate environmental concerns at their sole expense. Additional information may be available from the MDEQ Storage Tank Database.

Satellite communication facility for chatting with extra terrestrials. This one appears to be in generally excellent condition. Appears to have been winterized, but we can't be certain of that. No clear signs of freeze damage. Neighbor keeps removing the sign, so there is one in the front window to identify it. Some personal property still here. Power service has been dropped and will need an inspection to reconnect. This parcel appears to contain \"personal property\" that may be of value. Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/116000"},

There is evidence posted which indicates that a lender may be attempting to foreclose upon this parcel after such parcel was foreclosed for delinquent property taxes. A purchaser may encounter future contact from this lender. Tax foreclosure supersedes the rights of mortgage holders. If a mortgage holder does not foreclose upon their mortgage interest prior to tax foreclosure, their right to do so is generally lost. Typically such mortgage holders were provided all necessary notice of tax foreclosure but failed to act in a timely fashion to preserve their interest.

It is irregular in shape (see attached image map). It is the former yard and fleet terminal for a local construction company, and includes two buildings in salvageable condition if reuse is intended. The location lends itself to development as a residential or multi-family development parcel. Located just off M-32, it sits north of Home Depot, WalMart, Applebees and other commercial anchors. There is municipal water and sewer in the area as well as natural gas. The two buildings total roughly 20,000 square feet and could be rehabilitated if investment was made in roofing and exteriors. The larger of the two buildings, about 15,000 square feet, includes a small office area as well as high bay shop space with a half dozen large truck size overhead doors. The smaller building is lower ceiling cold storage space and warehousing. The grounds are somewhat cluttered with numerous piles of inert construction cast-offs including concrete drain pipe and culverts, pvc piping, brush and lumber scrap. There are a couple of spots where 55 gallon metal drums and tires are piled from fleet maintenance. There does not appear to be any evidence of surface dumping or contamination, but you'd certainly want to conduct a baseline environmental assessment (BEA) of those areas as well as study and sample whatever area the discharge from the floor drains and other areas around the two barns may flow to. We'd suggest that much of the site has been filled, as the rear portion of the lands appear to be more natural in soils and topography. This site is NOT listed on the MDEQ Environmental mapper and we saw no evidence of underground storage tanks from our cursory examination. The private road past the gated entrance to the property is shared with WATZ Radio (tower located to the west) and a couple of other users. The property may be viewed by qualified parties by prior appointment with the Treasurers office. Again, we *strongly* suggest that you familiarize yourself with the requirements of baseline environmental assessments (BEA) prior to bidding. A visual inspection of this parcel indicates potential environmental contamination. Visual indicators can include things like used tires, dirty soils, or chemically intensive former uses such as dry cleaning. Prospective bidders should carefully research the condition of this property prior to bidding. You may with to contact the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality or other relevant state agencies for additional guidance. Purchasers are strongly advised to obtain a Baseline Environmental Assessment (BEA). Some basic information about BEA can be found here.

{"title": "M-65 Hale ", "comments": "Note Size This parcel is what we refer to as a 33'/66'. We frequently see foreclosed parcels that are either 33 or 66 feet wide. These parcels are often a result of existing or former road rights of way. A common road right of way is 66 feet wide. Half of that is 33 feet. There are two common scenarios that we see. Scenario 1: A land owner splits a tract of land and creates a common easement parcel for access. They might then quit paying taxes on the parcel with road frontage knowing that the easement would remain even after foreclosure. Such easements are generally either 33 or 66 feet wide. Scenario 2: Rural land generally runs to the center of any public road on which it fronts whereas subdivided land usually runs to the edge of the road right-of-way. Sometimes during surveys or other splits, half of the right-of-way (usually 33 feet) can become orphaned, effectively turning to no-man's-land. Potential bidders should be aware that 33 and 66 foot wide parcels are very likely to include easements. That means that there are people who have a right to use the property even though they do not own the land. It is unlawful to cut off access over a 33 or 66 foot parcel where an easement already exists. Even if an easement doesn't already exists, courts will frequently create such an easement to prevent a neighboring parcel from becoming landlocked. Potential bidders should consider that this parcel likely has little value and cannot be used to landlock a neighboring parcel when there is no other path for ingress and egress.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/115104"},

A purchaser may encounter future contact from this lender. Tax foreclosure supersedes the rights of mortgage holders. If a mortgage holder does not foreclose upon their mortgage interest prior to tax foreclosure, their right to do so is generally lost. Typically such mortgage holders were provided all necessary notice of tax foreclosure but failed to act in a timely fashion to preserve their interest. In rare instances it may be necessary to cancel a sale if a deficiency in notice to such a lender is discovered.

{"title": "Beautiful Remote River Frontage On The Ford River!", "comments": "This is some very stunning riverfrontage on the swift, rocky Ford River in the south end of Marquette County. Please be aware that this parcel may not have deeded access, as it does not front on any improved road. The trail closest to the parcel is a rutted muddy trail during wet seasons, but it is hundreds of feet away. You'll want to research easement rights prior to bidding if that is important to you. You can also kayak or canoe your way in from the area around the bridge on the paved highway, a couple of miles downstream. There is physical (but not necessarily legal) approach from the SW corner, as an adjacent landowner has a trail cut to the banks of the river. You might be able to purchase an easement from them (?) This parcel is roughly 1 acre in size. Absolutely beautiful property. There are marshlands around here, but USGS topo maps suggest that this parcel is mostly uplands. There is no power *anywhere* near this parcel. River View Cottages is nearby and may be able to give you more information on the river life! Our visual inspection indicated that electrical service was not available on or near this parcel. The nearest electric service appeared to be a considerable distance (hundreds or perhaps thousands of feet) from the property. As such, electrifying this parcel could be costly. Please conduct your own research prior to bidding. This parcel does not front on a public or privately deeded improved road. Often times there are easements in the recorded chain-of-title that provide legal access to such parcels but other times there are not.

{"title": "Wow. Wow. Wow. 278+ Acres Of Riverfront!", "comments": "Four parcels. 278+ acres. Almost FOUR THOUSAND feet of frontage on the middle branch of the Escanaba River! USGS topographical maps indicate that very little of this property is marshland. There are trails from the area where the buildings are located to the river, but they are currently blocked by downed trees and brush (natural, not placed obstacles). This is VERY NICE UPLAND PROPERTY and terrific wildlife habitat. This land has not been cut over or timbered recently, and there are mixture of varieties and ages in the forestry mix. There is a modern cabin here, but it was built without ANY permits and has been condemned and it is not legal to occupy without inspection and compliance. It does not have to be demolished ... but you DO have to prove that it meets code and/or correct those deficiencies that cause it not to. One defects may be that this cabin has no foundation or perimeter footing. It is feasible to lift and move this structure to a nearby new foundation to correct that problem. You will most efficiently be able to manage the permitting process by contracting with a qualified architect. There are at least two submersible wells near the house. The larger of the outbuildings houses a substantial automatic power generator and has a manual unit for backup. The interior of the home is clean and modern. It does have a septic system, but we believe that it (again) was installed without proper permits and will require inspection and validation. BE ADVISED: The former owner of this property does not acknowledge the right of the government to tax property, and asserts that they still own it and have placed a \"common law lien\" against it. This may require legal proceedings on the part of the buyer to defend and/or clear title to obtain title insurance and re-sell. Would make an outstanding retreat, family compound or hunt club! To locate: GIS cordinates of the building cluster is N 46.32985, W -87.56567. There is an address marker, \"2650\" on County Road 565. You will need to follow that shared drive in roughly ONE MILE to reach the gate to the property. At one point on the shared drive, you will find a second \"2650\" marker. Take the right drive (look for pink survey marker tape). At a point a few hundred feet further up the drive you will find a half dozen pink survey tape markers. That is the boundary of the parcel. Beyond that the property is gated. We ask that you respect the locked gate and do not enter beyond it with any motorized vehicle, but only by foot. The buildings are 1000 feet or so beyond the gate. The buildings contain personal property that WE DO NOT HAVE TITLE TO. It remains the property of the former owner. DO NOT ENTER ANY BUILDINGS even if unlocked or open. There are trail cams in this area and persons entering the buildings without authorization will be prosecuted. Please look, but DO NOT ENTER the buildings. Thank you. This parcel has been posted as \"Condemned\" by the local building authority. Properties are generally condemned when they are deemed substandard, unsafe, or otherwise unfit for use and habitation. Condemned property must be rehabilitated to meet local building codes prior to use or occupancy. A building is not automatically slated for demolition when condemned. However, this does not necessarily mean that demolition will not also be pursued by the local unit. Please check with the local building official before bidding to determine the specific status and requirements for this property. We have reason to believe that this property was last owned (and may still be occupied or monitored) by someone that does not recognize the right of the government to tax or foreclose upon their property.

{"title": "Commercial Redevelopment Opportunity In Iron Mountain", "comments": "This sale includes a substantial and modern building that has been previously used as a nursing home. It was constructed in 1973 with a more recent addition, and appears to have been well maintained until its use was discontinued about 3 years ago. This facility has two wings, and is entirely one story, slab-on-grade. The roof is EPDM rubber membrane and looks reasonably fresh. The east wing contains a large and well furnished commercial kitchen, commercial laundry, dining and recreation area, administrative office area, and the mechanical plant. Within the mechanical plant area there is a 600A 3 phase electrical service with a natural gas fired Genset capable of delivering 60A 3 phase for critical circuits during power outages. There is a substantial steam boiler for heat and an AHU for air change. This area also houses the control for the FM approved fire suppression (sprinkler) system and fire detection/warning alarm. And there is enough hot water to satisfy any demand from two industrial fast recovery units. The plumbing through out the building was professionally winterized during de-commissioning. It is our impression that the former operators had the staff thoroughly clean and organize the entire facility before closing with an eye toward a resale that never occurred. This property .... from kitchen wares, lobby and dining room settings to linens, is nearly completely furnished and ready to reopen. There is no obvious debris, no trash, nothing is dirty, and nothing where it should not be. The west wing contains numerous janitorial and staff office rooms, as well as 26 patient rooms, almost evenly split between two corridors running north and south. Each two patient rooms share a common 2 piece (stool and sink) bathroom. This arrangement would be ideal for conversion into departmental office suites, with the baths being useful for secured file storage where not retained for their original purpose. There is a central nursing station that would make an excellent support staff node. The main entrance is bright and inviting. This facility can be purchased for a fraction of what it would cost to reproduce, which would certainly be into the millions of dollars.

{"title": "Large Craftsman Era Home In Escanaba. Duplex Use.", "comments": "Fabulous Craftsman era home near the Lakeshore Drive neighborhood on Escanabas east side. There are two considerations here: the potential, and the current conditions. POTENTIAL: This is a wonderful, almost original condition example of the Craftsman architectural style. It's got all of the requisites: Coffered ceilings, leaded glass doors, hardwood floors, fireplaces (2), ornate wood trim and a myriad of built-ins from pantries and cabinetry to walk-ins to window seats. Very little of this has ever been touched with a paint brush, and it remains is superb, restorable condition. The only hackery we really saw was a second floor kitchen that was clearly kitchen cabinets that screamed 80's. (1980's that is). In some quarters, the vinyl siding also falls into the definition of a sin, however the expense of painting a house this size can be staggering, so we'll give it a pass. CONDITIONS: Structurally this house is a rock. It is solid, straight and square. The foundation is as good as new, The roof is in need of replacement, but this has not transmitted itself to ANY interior damage other than the fact that squirrels and birds have taken up residence in the eaves ... which need repair along with the porches ... when the new roof goes on. The primary conditional concern here is the rubbish inside. The main floor unit is literally carpeted with several inches ... perhaps a FOOT in some locations ... of food packaging, dog feces, and (no exaggeration here) probably 3000 beer cans. This is matted down and has been sitting for so long that it doesn't even smell at the moment. This will require professional remediation at least to disinfecting and ozonating once it is all removed. This has affected to a much lesser degree the upper floor unit. It appears that this home was likely BUILT AS a duplex, and not a landlord butcher job. The side entrance and stairway to the upper unit do not appear to have ever been a part of the main floor unit, and each has its own living room, kitchen, bath and two bedrooms. The layouts are not identical, but are similar. The upper unit also has access to a wonderful walk-up third floor that has one finished extra bedroom type space and other area which could be finished. Each unit has a fireplace. Both units have access to the basement. We believe that the home originally had steam heat, but it now appears to be forced air. We did not locate the electrical panels with some limited searching. In short, this is a wonderful opportunity to get a Craftsman style home in a great neighborhood. Are you up to the task? This property is unsanitary and poses a potential health hazard because of raw food garbage, backed up sewer lines, or other similar waste. Such conditions can attract rodents, wild animals, and other vermin.

{"title": "House With Severe Foundation Issues. Ontonagon", "comments": "We've sold this one (and the one next door too) a couple of times before ... and like the bad penny .... it returns. Older one story mid-century frame construction. Sits on a footing system that backs up to a ravine and it is slooooowly collapsing from underneath. Most of the foundation at the front of the house has collapsed, and it's just a matter of time til house-go-boom. But hey, it's got a newer furnace! The house itself actually isn't bad and would be worth moving. But the logistics with the steep ravine behind it makes that impractical. The foundation of one or more buildings located on this parcel appears to be failing. Correcting foundation issues can be very expensive and issues are often more complex than they initially appear. You should research this issue thoroughly prior to bidding on this parcel. This parcel has substantial structural issues caused by poor design, insufficient maintenance, or both. Such buildings may be subject to condemnation orders which we were unable to locate during our inspection. All such buildings should be brought into compliance with local building regulations prior to use. We strongly recommend that you contact the local building code official and consider consulting a competent structural engineer to assess the condition of this property before to bidding. This parcel includes a structure which should be considered DANGEROUS. This building has suffered structural damage which creates substantial risk of harm from falling through damaged areas or collapse from above. It may also contain extensive debris which could fall or collapse, rusty nails, broken glass, and other hazards. You are not permitted to enter this or any other structure offered at tax sale. You should limit your inspection only to what can be safely observed from the building's exterior. Trespassers are subject to prosecution.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/116247"},

That is the SE corner of the parcel being sold. There is no road IN to the parcel from this point, but we believe that this is physical access TO the parcel. USGS topo maps indicate that the parcel is a rolling, wooded parcel with little if any marshlands. It is very near the Ontonagon River (1/4 mile) and seems to be nicely wooded and probably not timbered anytime recently. You may want to walk the property to verify these observations. According to the assessor, there is a small 320sq ft cabin with no utility service on this parcel. Our inspector did not locate it when visiting the property, so it's current status is unknown.

{"title": "Two Story Commercial Building In Downtown Rockland.", "comments": "This one isn't shot, yet, but it's headed there in a hurry. Historically this has been a pool hall. In more recent years only the second floor was used as a residence. The roof is generally bad and leaking in several spots. That has transmitted to the main level where it has warped hardwood flooring. The foundation on the left/south side of the building could not be examined without a ladder to the basement, but it could be an issue tho its not stressing the side wall. The side and back stairways and porches are creeky and need attention. It certainly needs a roof. We're told by Ray (the overseer who you will undoubtedly meet if you visit this one) that the former owner had a new boiler put into the basement before he died, which was about 6 or 7 years ago. Has potential, but will require a lot of work and deep pockets. There is no active electric or water service here, but we have a hunch this may be squatter territory. Ask Ray.

Our review of this parcel indicates that the noted State Equalized Value (SEV) does not appear to reflect the current value of the property. This is often due to buildings or other improvements being demolished or fire damaged or other similar items included in the SEV being removed from the property. It can also be due to market changes in the area in which the property is located. It should be further noted that the SEV/assessed value of the parcel as noted in this listing may be several years old. You should consult a local real estate professional or appraiser to help you assess the current market value of this property before bidding and should not base your valuation on the stated SEV. This parcel is too small to be practically useful under most circumstances. Many times such parcels are the result of survey or property transfer errors which create small orphaned slivers of land.

Property tax foreclosure affects only \"real property.\" In general, real property includes the land and those things physically attached to it. This sale includes only such real property. However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address. However, it is the responsibility of the winning bidder to determine what personal property is present on the parcel and the appropriate measures for handling such personal property. This property is occupied. Please respect the privacy of current occupants and limit any inspection to what can be safely observed from the road. Some occupants may be upset or angry and may meet contact with aggression or violence. Please use discretion and caution when researching this or other occupied properties.

One bath up, half bath on main, and a potty in the basement too. The second floor has peeling paint and wallpaper but it is from age, and not a bad roof. The roof here is mid-life and does not appear to leak. We noticed cracks in the front two corners of the foundation, but they have not transmitted to the interior or the structure itself. Has faux brick fiberboard siding over what may be restorable lap siding. The mechanicals (heat, electric, plumbing) here are all ancient and could use updating. It does have a pretty modern upgraded municipal water main. BONUS: This home has a walk up third story that could be a magnificent master suite. Basement has interior and exterior entrances. This is an older home, but it is in very very solid condition and worthy of your consideration. It is mostly in need of mechanical updating and aesthetic attention.

It has an addition/garage to the south side that has failed and needs to come off immediately, before it rips away from the house and perhaps taking some of it along for the ride. The main floor bathroom floor is weak and heaved/mushy which is an indicator of freeze/water damage. The house itself has great potential after you remove the garage, dejunk it and give it a good once over. It needs a new electrical. The plumbing is a hodge-podge of materials and probably needs a general overhaul. There are three bedrooms upstairs PLUS a third floor walkup attic with potential for extra living space. Hardwood floors thru-out. This is a large solid house that needs attention. Last occupancy appears to be about 2011. This property contains physical indications that one or more water lines have frozen, ruptured, and leaked for a significant period of time prior to being shut off.

Foundation appears serviceable. Has a gaping hole in the side where they removed windows to pitch stuff onto the lawn (no dumpster?). Furnace is older but probably still serviceable. Ancient electrical needs an upgrade. They started plumbing with some Pex, but its very amateur and you'll wanna redo it. Roof is mid life and should be good for a bit. The curb appeal is not good here, but this one actually has potential. The previous owner of this parcel undertook a construction or rehabilitation project which has not been completed.

It will probably require a professional fumigation/cleaning (ie: ServiceMaster etc) to really efficiently manage it. We assume it'll be really ripe by August. We would consider this a shell in need of a total rehab because of the odor and general surface conditions indoors. This property is unsanitary and poses a potential health hazard because of raw food garbage, backed up sewer lines, or other similar waste. Such conditions can attract rodents, wild animals, and other vermin. You should bid accordingly and be prepared to mitigate the situation immediately upon purchase.

The topography here drops 15ish feet from road grade to the lake level. There is a level cleared area at road grade that would lend itself to construction of a nice walkout basement home that would give great attention to the creek view. There is a road from the roadside site down toward the lake that has a couple of fallen trees preventing use currently. Its not substantially improved, but it does look like someone started the process of finding a natural path and clearing it. There are lot boundary markers at the east and west lines. There are POA fees here for road maintenance. You'll want to discover what the POA rules and fees are prior to bidding. We saw two other homes in this development on the south shore of the lake. This is a private wilderness / fishing lake and not a jet ski mecca.

One is a nearly move-in ready home, and the other was probably commercial at one time and needs to be demolished. The home is clean. straight and could be one of the most \"ready to use\" homes in the Houghton County sale this year. It is a modified 4-square design featuring three bedrooms and a bath up, and a full basement with interior and exterior entrances. It has great attic access for extra storage or development. The furnace and water heater are merchantable, though the water heater has odd damage to the jacket which we have not seen before and does not appear to be freeze damage. This home has been well maintained for many years and has little to be done other than decor change as an option. The roof is older but serviceable. The basement walls could stand a coat of thoroseal, but they're solid. Building number two, on the other hand, needs to come down. The rear portion has collapsed, access to the second floor is treacherous, and we did not examine it closely because it's just simply a basket case and needs to go. It is separately described. There is also a full, vacant lot to the west that serves as access and parking for the home. This tax parcel ID and SEV is for the vacant lot. The PID# and SEV for the two buildings is the next description. Purchaser will be required to furnish a personal guarantee and cash surety in the amount of $25,000.00 (the \"Surety\") to ensure the demolition and remediation of the offered property to a safe and debris-free condition. Certified funds in the amount of the Surety shall be deposited with seller or its designee within 5 days of the auction. If the Surety is not presented within 5 days of the auction, the sale shall be canceled for non-performance without refund. Purchaser must present a plan to seller within 60 days of the auction which includes a cost estimate and timeline for the demolition of all structures located on the offered property by a licensed and insured contractor. Such plan must be approved by seller at seller's sole discretion prior to the commencement of demolition and remediation activities. Such demolition and remediation shall be completed within six months of the date of the auction. Demolition shall be considered complete upon certification of seller and at seller's sole discretion. The Surety shall be applied to the costs of demolition and remediation in accordance with the approved plan. Any costs incurred over and above the Surety are the sole responsibility of purchaser. Any Surety which remains after seller certifies the satisfactory completion of all demolition and remediation activities shall be returned to purchaser. If purchaser fails to comply with any of the terms and restrictions stated herein, they shall forfeit the Surety to seller. Seller has the unilateral right to accept, reject or require modification to the Surety prior to its acceptance by seller. Purchaser has NO RIGHT TO POSSESSION or entry upon the offered property until seller executes and records a deed conveying the offered property to purchaser. This is the description for the second building in this grouping. We didn't go through the inside of this one (the law of diminishing returns applies here).

It appears that it's got nice wood floors and trim (unpainted) and the ceilings and floors are in great overall condition. No heaving or dips noticed in floors. It all just really really dirty and layered in trash and animal feces. The basement was not accessible because of rubbish in the way, but we could not see any flood issues down there, just more garbage. The electric service is down and will need to be restored. The presence of radiators suggests a boiler. We did not see a gas meter, so we assume its an older fuel oil unit and probably not in great condition.

This property is unsanitary and poses a potential health hazard because of raw food garbage, backed up sewer lines, or other similar waste. Such conditions can attract rodents, wild animals, and other vermin. You should bid accordingly and be prepared to mitigate the situation immediately upon purchase. Pet and/or wild animal waste was observed within this property. Potential bidders should consider that urine stains/odors can be difficult to remove from porous surfaces such as wood floors or underlayment.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/114974"},

We're told by locals that there is high water table here, and the USGS topo maps certainly reinforce that by indicating there is swamp right out back. The Presque Isle River is just a couple hundred feet to the east. The condemnation is probably from a combination of a bad roof and we assume that the septic system here probably is waterlogged part of the year and needs redesign. Curiously, there is very little interior damage from the roof. The house seems fairly straight and solid other than weak floors in the back porch entry. It does have potential if one were to re-roof it (which will require some replacement of eave materials as well) and a new septic most likely. It IS condemned, so contact the village code enforcement people (probably the county building inspector) and make sure you know what you're dealing with before bidding. Two bedrooms on the main floor. 2 more upstairs with 2 walk-thru rooms and a large common area/playroom/study at the rear. One or more buildings on this parcel has a roof which is either leaking to the interior or appears close to failure. Failing roofs often indicate substantial structural decay inside the building. You should investigate the integrity of this structure(s) prior to bidding. This parcel has been posted as \"Condemned\" by the local building authority. Properties are generally condemned when they are deemed substandard, unsafe, or otherwise unfit for use and habitation. Condemned property must be rehabilitated to meet local building codes prior to use or occupancy. A building is not automatically slated for demolition when condemned. However, this does not necessarily mean that demolition will not also be pursued by the local unit. Please check with the local building official before bidding to determine the specific status and requirements for this property.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/114933"},

{"title": "Development Opportunity In A Ski Resort Setting!", "comments": "Powdermill Creek Resort and Conference Center is, (in theory), a nightly lodging provider in the Big Powderhorn Mountain ski area. In its more recent incarnation, it has been mostly a transient housing and monthly rental debacle mixed with full-time residency. Not much \"resort\" traffic here in some time. In the original design, this was a mini-resort of 50ish hotel type rooms and mini-townhouses, with several bars, food service operations and an indoor pool, in close proximity (but independent of) the nearby Big Powderhorn Mountain ski operations. The pool, bars and food service have not been open for business in many years on a regular basis. There is no liquor license currently associated with this property, and most of the rooms that are included in this offering are vacant and need work. There are roughly 54 residential units in this property, and we are offering 25 PLUS the \"core\" unit which comprises the bar, food service and recreational areas of the building as a single package. We are offering 15 main floor units, 7 second floor (cathedral ceiling) units, and the \"core\" food and beverage units. For general reference, please see : https://powdermillresort.blogspot.com/ Be aware that there is a dedicated community that individually own the remaining units here, many of whom have been doggedly pursuing POA duties and goals for many years. In addition to association fees for maintenance of the property, these units are also subject to a SPECIAL ASSESSMENT for a water/sewer district improvement. AS A CONDITION OF SALE, the seller *MAY* require a purchaser to pay the entire balance of the special assessment for all units being sold IN FULL prior to issuing a deed at the sellers sole discretion. This is an exciting opportunity for an experienced and well financed developer to acquire a great ski lodging opportunity at a bargain price. Contact he Gogebic County Treasurers office or the auction house for complete details on this opportunity. This property is occupied. Please respect the privacy of current occupants and limit any inspection to what can be safely observed from the road. Some occupants may be upset or angry and may meet contact with aggression or violence. Please use discretion and caution when researching this or other occupied properties. Furthermore, although this property has been foreclosed for unpaid taxes, occupants have certain rights under Michigan law and must be formally evicted if unwilling to leave voluntarily. You may wish to consult a licensed attorney for more information. This property includes an outstanding special assessment. Local units of government often borrow money for projects such as streets, water/sewer, lighting, and other public infrastructure improvements. These costs are then assess to the owners of affected property over a period of years in installments added to the annual tax bill. All past installments of these assessments are included in the minimum bid price. The purchaser assumes liability for all future installments of these assessments. We would advise prospective bidders to investigate the balance due on all special assessments as well as the ongoing annual cost before bidding.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/114906"},

There is a crack running from the kitchen along the west wall of the cabin, and the floor has dropped an inch or two, showing some daylight nder the west wall just to the side of the door on that side. It appears that the cabin was built on a thin (2 or 3 inch) slab-on-grade and may not have any sort of footing to support that weight bearing for the wall.

The store closure and this sale are the result of medical disability of the former owner. This is a generally well maintained property and it is COMPLETLY equipped and ready to open back up. YOU ARE BIDDING ON THE REAL ESTATE ONLY in this auction, but the winning bidder may have the opportunity to also purchase the SDM and SDD licenses, as well as the personal property/equipment contents of the store, subject to the approval of the Michigan Liquor Control Commission and payment of several outstanding liens which encumber the license. These liens amount to roughly $120,000. In lieu of that option, you could also operate without alcoholic beverage sales, or find licenses elsewhere. The licenses are in escrow, and the former owner retains the right to sell them, which has been delegated to the auction house to manage. Please see the photos for a definitive description of this property. There is walk-in merchandiser/cooler, and a kitchen that has been used to generate sausage, pizza and deli sandwiches for many years including a buffalo chopper (burger grinder) and band saw for processing meat. The house and the store share a common well and septic system. There is onsite parking for roughly a dozen cars in a gravel parking lot to the east of the building.

The structure is essentially straight and solid, but needs a roof, resurfacing and HVAC and plumbing repair. Electrical service is modern, however we could not find either a meter base or a service drop on the outside. Exterior, porches, fascia and soffits all need attention. Three bedrooms plus a walk-thru study/playroom up, and a 4th bedroom downstairs. Exterior basement entrance. Could be a decent place, but needs work. One or more buildings on this parcel has a roof which is either leaking to the interior or appears close to failure. Failing roofs often indicate substantial structural decay inside the building. You should investigate the integrity of this structure(s) prior to bidding.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/115769"},

Upper floor features three bedrooms and a bath that does not have a shower or tub ... and we did not see one of those anywhere here either. Basement has been somewhat finished into living space. There is a good amount of debris to remove here, but the bones seem to be good. The roof is not leaking (yet) inside, but the soffits and eaves are really shredded ... probably be raccoons that may be residing in the attic.

{"title": "Historic Home With Much Potential. Benzonia!", "comments": "A decade or more ago, this home had a small fire in the south one story porch addition. It has been vacant ever since. Some of that porch area was torn up a little to make sure the fire was out, but there is no substantial structural damage caused from it. A subsequent buyer started the process of gutting the main floor, and stopped without getting much accomplished. The home has some boarded windows and doors on the main floor, mostly the result of vandalism while sitting empty. The roof is older and probably in need or replacement soon, but at this time it is not leaking. The front porch needs substantial work, as both its perimeter footing wall (freestanding from the house) and the front porch roof and deck are decayed and beyond simple repair ... they need replacement. The home has 3 bedrooms and a quasi-kitchen on the second floor, and there is both a formal staircase at the front as well as a \"maids\" staircase to the upper level from the kitchen area. The second floor is pretty much intact, and was affected by neither the small fire or any subsequent remodeling demo. One car attached garage. The power service here has been dropped. Electric service is an older, decaying off brand panel board in the basement, which also has a fused subpanel on the second floor. We'd replace the main panel, as well as the boiler and water heaters right off the bat. The boiler piping seems to be intact, and while it may need some patching from freeze damage in places, it would be far more efficient to replace the boiler than to duct the home. The yard at one time was likely very nicely landscaped. it is now difficult to get to the south side of the house or to see most of the house from the road because of the overgrowth. The septic system here has been inspected, and appears to be sufficient and properly sized, but it's not guaranteed. This is a sturdy, straight home that needs someone to restore it and bring it back to life. Located on the top-of-the-knob in Benzonia, right on US-31. The Sewage Treatment System was inspected on June 11, 2019 The inspection has determined the system's construction, location and condition to be Satisfactory. The home is served by the Village of Benzonia's Water Supply System. SEWAGE SYSTEM EVALUATION COMMENTS: The home is served by a 1600 - D gallon septic tank and 900 square feet of drain field installed in 1997. Borings into the drain field revealed no signs of sewage ponding or black stone. Some evidence of tree rooting was noted, which may shorten the usable life of the system. It should also be noted that the house is currently vacant, so it's condition may not be reflective of a system in a \"continual\" use state. The system appears to be functioning at this time. If and when the drain field fails, suitable soils and area appear to be available for a replacement system. To help prolong the life of the system, routine pumping of the septic tank is recommended. The application did not indicate when the septic tank was last pumped, so it should be checked and pumped now, if solids indicate. Report pumping to this office. Maintenance practices include diverting surface water drainage away from the system, keeping the area mowed, not driving heavy vehicles or plowing snow over the drain field, limiting water usage, diverting water softener discharge out of system, spreading clothes washing loads over long periods, checking for leaking fixtures, and routine pumping of the tank (i.e., every 3-5 yrs.)", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/114331"},

This parcel has been posted as \"Condemned\" by the local building authority. Properties are generally condemned when they are deemed substandard, unsafe, or otherwise unfit for use and habitation. Condemned property must be rehabilitated to meet local building codes prior to use or occupancy. A building is not automatically slated for demolition when condemned. However, this does not necessarily mean that demolition will not also be pursued by the local unit. Please check with the local building official before bidding to determine the specific status and requirements for this property. This parcel includes structures which have been damaged by fire. It is up to the auction purchaser to determine if this property can be restored to a safe condition and to comply with all relevant local regulations and building codes.

This parcel may contain buried storage tanks from previous use as a gas station or similar enterprise. Our analysis is based solely on visual inspection of the property surface as further detailed in the lot description.

{"title": "Ten Acres With Older Mobile And Garage. Jennings.", "comments": "Parcel fronts 330' feet on the north side of Rosted Road, and runs 1320' feet deep. The west side of the property has an older mobile that we believe has freeze damage in the left/west end around the bathroom based on the sponginess in the floors. Also a bucket hanging from the skylight infers that the roof leaks there (not unusual in mobile skylights). Other than the floor in the west end, it seems fairly solid, just stinky and needs a good cleaning. Something in the east end bedroom smells of urine or such. The two care garage has some food garbage stinking it up. It'll be really ripe by sale day. No extra charge. There is a camper out in the woods behind the mobile, and we don't have title to it. The east side of the property appears to have been a mobile home pad, and the power service is still there. Did not see a well, but there could be one in the weeds. The property has been used for pasture or such in the front, as there is an electric fence there. Several sheds and outbuildings appear to have been used to house their critters. Nice level wooded property with nice oaks in the mix. With some repair, this could be a decent little pad. This property contains physical indications that one or more water lines have frozen, ruptured, and leaked for a significant period of time prior to being shut off. Such indications can include damage to ceilings and floors and visibly damaged pipes and fixtures. Damage from freeze bursts can be substantial including significant harm to structural components such as framing and foundations.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/115935"},

Will need a general overhaul of wiring and plumbing. The well is lost in the grass. One bedroom, one bath, one car attached garage/shed. The major issue with this one is some washout to the foundation. It has not transmitted itself to the structure (yet) but it will if not attended to.

Nicely wooded square 40, 1320' x 1320'. Appears to be entirely uplands except perhaps a small portion in the NE corner. It appears that there is no legal access to this parcel. From Turnerville Road, the parcel begins at 1/4 mile in, and ends at 1/2 mile in. The property is nicely wooded with many younger maples and white pine predominating the forestry. It is sandy, well drained soil and carpeted in ferns. Beautiful land. Our visual inspection indicated that electrical service was not available on or near this parcel. The nearest electric service appeared to be a considerable distance (hundreds or perhaps thousands of feet) from the property. As such, electrifying this parcel could be costly.

{"title": "Large Multi-Purpose Building In Merritt!", "comments": "We are offering three adjoining parcels, totaling over FIVE ACRES that contains a large building with many potential uses. In its original incarnation, this was a public school building. It appears to have been well maintained and modernized during that time, including substantial upgrades as recently as 1995. It appears to have a good roof, likely TPO membrane or a similar product. It appears that the buildings heat pipes are wrapped with fiberglass and not asbestos (generally), another major consideration. This building has two wings, east and west. It is not large as most school properties are, and is likely in the range of 10,000&gt;12,000 square feet or so. All of the improvements are on one floor, which is slab-on-grade, negating almost all ADA design issues. The east (older) wing contains 4 large rooms, probably each in the range of 750 square feet. These have potential either as configured or modified. There are multiple occupancy bathrooms and a boiler room in the east wing, with a fairly modern boiler system. At the west end of the east wing is a small gymnasium (not regulation size) that may have doubled as a cafeteria. This is the largest room in the building, and weighs in around 5,000 square feet. The building has a very modest kitchen area adjacent to this room, which does not have ventilation for cooking. So the mystery meat here would have been cold cuts. The newest part of the building is the west wing, which has one room about 500 square feet, and several smaller rooms (office size) as well as a pair of ADA compliant bathrooms. The building has limited fire sprinkler coverage, which appears to run off its domestic water supply, powered by a 5hp pump. It has 400A single phase electrical service. There is water damage in random spots that appear to be the result off frozen plumbing, and we specifically noticed some cracks in boiler pipe elbows (see photo) and a utility water heater that has stress indicators. The freeze damage is the largest snafu in what is otherwise a pretty solid building. The potential for the building is wide ranging, from charter school to multifamily residential or AFC uses; government office, church, warehousing, light industrial or even grow facility (gasp!) You will want to check your potential use with local zoning officials. There are three parcels here, including substantial parking, 5 acres more or less of vacant land and even your own playground. This property contains physical indications that one or more water lines have frozen, ruptured, and leaked for a significant period of time prior to being shut off. Such indications can include damage to ceilings and floors and visibly damaged pipes and fixtures. Damage from freeze bursts can be substantial including significant harm to structural components such as framing and foundations.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/115928"},

{"title": "2.5 Acres In Mancelona", "comments": "The only access to this property seems to be a two track road that goes through adjacent private parcels. Interested bidders will want to research this thoroughly to find out if there is legal access to this property before bidding. This parcel does not front on a public or privately deeded improved road. Often times there are easements in the recorded chain-of-title that provide legal access to such parcels but other times there are not. You should thoroughly research this parcel's access rights prior to bidding. It can require expensive, complicated, and time consuming legal proceedings to secure legal access to landlocked parcels that do not have easements for ingress and egress. The roads which are shown on plat or tax maps for this parcel do not appear to exist or may be located in a different location than shown on such maps. While a legal right to build such roads may remain, this construction would likely be very expensive. However, in some instances these unimproved roads have been vacated or abandoned by action of the local government and no such right to construct the roads remains. Issues surrounding unimproved roads can be complicated and expensive to resolve. You should investigate the existence of any roads and the ability to access this parcel thoroughly before bidding.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/113999"},

A purchaser may encounter future contact from this lender. Tax foreclosure supersedes the rights of mortgage holders. If a mortgage holder does not foreclose upon their mortgage interest prior to tax foreclosure, their right to do so is generally lost. Typically such mortgage holders were provided all necessary notice of tax foreclosure but failed to act in a timely fashion to preserve their interest. In rare instances it may be necessary to cancel a sale if a deficiency in notice to such a lender is discovered. Please contact us or ask questions at the sale if you have concerns about this issue.

Our review of this parcel indicates that the noted State Equalized Value (SEV) does not appear to reflect the current value of the property. This is often due to buildings or other improvements being demolished or fire damaged or other similar items included in the SEV being removed from the property. It can also be due to market changes in the area in which the property is located. It should be further noted that the SEV/assessed value of the parcel as noted in this listing may be several years old.

Cement driveway runs along the side of the home and leads to a detached one car garage. There is a wood staircase on the back of the home that leads to the second story apartment. This house will need a lot of work before its back in living condition. One or more structures was boarded when we conducted our assessment of this parcel. Properties may be boarded for a variety of reasons. For example, properties are often boarded to prevent trespassers from harvesting copper plumbing, wiring, and other fixtures. Buildings may also be boarded by fire or other officials when they present a safety hazard. We generally do not enter boarded structures and limit our observations to the building's exterior. Likewise, you should limit any inspection of this property to its exterior only. You are not permitted to remove any boarding to view building interiors under any circumstances. Public property records or polite inquiries to neighbors may reveal additional information about a property's history. The building on this property appears to have been used for multi-family occupancy in the past based upon indicators such as multiple mailboxes, entrances, numbering, layout, or other such factors. Modifications to the property may NOT have been legally made and may NOT conform to local zoning. Prospective bidders should verify with local officials that multi-family use is permitted under existing zoning. In many areas, once a multi-family use has been discontinued, it cannot be reinstated unless in conformance with local zoning and code.

{"title": "Bundle", "comments": "The parcels in this sale unit are grouped, (\"bundled\") as permitted by MCL 211.78m. Many of these include structures which contain lead based paint. Some may contain asbestos. Many are in various stages of disrepair or collapse and are considered dangerous buildings and attractive nuisance. Some may be occupied by tenants-holding-over under law. These parcels are not being offered individually. They must be purchased as a single bundle at or above the minimum bid price, if any is stated. Pursuant to MCL 211.78 (1), the Foreclosing Governmental Unit (FGU) has determined that the most efficient and expeditious method to return many of these parcels to productive use, is to require their immediate demolition, remediation, rehabilitation or repurposing if sold at auction. Many of these parcels constitute blight, a public nuisance and abatement is considered necessary. Before their sale to ANY purchaser at auction, it is the intent of the FGU that any such purchaser shall demonstrate their financial ability and willingness to perform those actions necessary, in the public interest and welfare, to bring the properties into compliance with local codes and ordinances. Therefore, it is a further requirement of sale of the bundled properties that a purchaser must demolish, remediate, rehabilitate or repurpose these properties as follows: 1) ALL STRUCTURES must be secured and made un-enterable within 15 days of sale at auction, at the purchasers sole expense, or the sale shall be cancelled and no refund or deed issued. 2) Any visible refuse, garbage, trash or other cast off shall be removed from lands within 15 days of the sale at auction, at the purchasers sole expense, or the sale shall be cancelled and no refund or deed issued.. 3) The conditions required in (1) and (2) above shall be maintained against further entry or blight for a period of 12 months following the execution of a deed. 4) Those properties in the bundle that are beyond reasonable repair or economic vitality to repair must be demolished at the sole expense of the purchaser. The cost of such work shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. All such demolition must be performed within 6 months of deeding, by a licensed, insured demolition contractor acceptable to the code official of the local unit of government where the property is located. All proper permits for demolition and the removal and disposal of volatile debris (asbestos, contaminants etc) must be obtained. 5) Those properties in the bundle which appear to either the purchaser, FGU or the code enforcement official of the local unit of government to be potentially contaminated, shall be the subject of a Baseline Environmental Assessment (BEA) at the sole expense of the purchaser. The cost of such BEA(s) shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. The BEA(s) shall be conducted by an insured environmental consultant licensed in the State of Michigan within 45 days of purchase, and shall be fully complete and filed with the proper authorities within 90 days of purchase. The level of the BEA to be conducted shall be determined by the findings of the initial phase(s) of the BEA at each parcel subject to such study. Where contamination is evident, the purchaser shall indemnify the FGU with a separate performance bond (issued on the same terms as others herein required) in an amount equal to the full cost of remediation of the contamination at each such site, and for a period of twenty (20) years, unless remediation is undertaken and completed during that time period. If the site is remediated to a level satisfactory to state officials charged with such determinations, the requirement for a performance bond shall be removed for that site. 6) Those properties in the bundle which can be rehabilitated or repurposed shall be brought into compliance with all construction, occupancy, zoning and other use codes of the local unit of government within 12 months. Construction and/or mechanical permits must be obtained prior to performing such work. Occupancy permits must be obtained by the expiration of that term. All construction and rehabilitation work at these properties shall be carried out by contractors that are licensed and insured, and acceptable to the code enforcement officer of the local unit of government. The cost of such work shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. In pursuance of those requirements and their costs and timelines, the FGU is requiring the posting of a performance bond in the amount of $1,000,000.00. The performance bond shall be made out in favor of the Office of the Kalamazoo County Treasurer (acting as the Foreclosing Governmental Unit). Evidence of the issuance and full payment for such bond shall be presented to the FGU within fifteen (15) days of the acceptance of the purchasers bid at auction. In the event evidence of issuance and full payment is not tendered within fifteen (15) days of sale, the sale shall be cancelled outright, and the purchaser considered non-responsive to a necessary condition of the sale. No receipt for the sale shall be issued, and the bidder shall not be entitled to enter upon such premises, until such bond is issued and deemed sufficient by the FGU. Such bond shall be issued by an underwriter licensed to do business in the State of Michigan, who is not the subject of any pending disciplinary action by the State of Michigan or any department, bureau or commission thereof. It shall be payable, in full amount, to the FGU in the event of either whole or partial non-performance of the terms above written for its entire duration. It shall run as effective and be fully pre-paid, for the entire term of twenty-four (24) months. Any overage or refund shall be payable to the purchaser upon earlier termination of the bond because of full performance hereunder. This 24 month time period is not applicable to those performance bonds required for contaminated parcels noted in (5) above. The original of such bond(s) shall be held by an escrow agent satisfactory to the FGU, fully prepaid, at the expense of the purchaser. In the event any purchaser is a corporate or other entity, the principals of such entity must also execute full-recourse personal guarantees that assure payment of the amount(s) due under performance bonds in the event they are not honored for any reason. Compliance with the terms of the requirements hereof shall be at the sole discretion of the FGU. This parcel does not front on a public or privately deeded improved road. Often times there are easements in the recorded chain-of-title that provide legal access to such parcels but other times there are not. You should thoroughly research this parcel's access rights prior to bidding. It can require expensive, complicated, and time consuming legal proceedings to secure legal access to landlocked parcels that do not have easements for ingress and egress.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/117008"},

A condominium is a form of land ownership which is divided up into individual \"units.\" Owners are required to be part of the applicable condominium association (COA) which includes rules and regulations related to the use and ownership of each unit. Additional restrictions will be spelled out in the development's master deed. Condominiums also include association fees which can be significant. Some condominium units delegate things like exterior maintenance and repair to the COA whereas the owner remains responsible for the unit's interior. However, there are many varieties of condominiums including residential and commercial interior space, condo subdivision lots, condo boat slips, condo campsites and others.

There are 5 bedrooms and 5 baths, including a mother-in-law or staff quarters over the three car attached garage. There are three bedrooms on the second floor and one in the lower level, which is roughly 75% finished, including a family room. The main level features a formal dining and living room, large kitchen and wet bar, three season room and an outdoor kitchen in a covered porch. The kitchen has some Sub-zero type refrigeration units installed, and includes a professional grade range and hood as fixtures. There are three fireplaces with gas logs. Also featured are a wine cellar, irrigation system, substantial electric service, and high technology control of environment, entertainment and security apparatus. It is furnished with transfer switching for a backup Genset and has a water softener system installed. Utility service here includes municipal water and sewer, as well as natural gas. The interior finish is wood and ceramic floors, and a professional design effort is obvious in the neutral colors and high end fixtures and finishes. Exterior is of stone and vinyl for low maintenance. The entire driveway is brick pavers. Very little has been spared in the way of outfitting this property. This structure is very close to being finished and habitable. The to-be-done list includes: replacement of missing home automation servers; some appliances; the master bathroom shower door installation (available - custom ordered) and routine maintenance to clean and freshen the property (it has been closed up for approximately 5 years). This property has been the subject of protracted litigation in several state and federal courts regarding the validity of the foreclosure, and the seller has prevailed at each such challenge. We anticipate being able to provide title insurance to the purchaser of this property. It was appraised in 2014 at $1.6M dollars USD. Due to the level of interest we anticipate in this property, it will be offered in a single parcel sale on-site, July 30, 2019. We will be announcing several open house dates prior to this sale on this page. We are not able to provide individual tours of the property because of the number of inquiries and available staffing levels. Viewing will be limited to those pre-qualified by evidence of sufficient liquid funds or a non-revocable letter of credit in an amount to pay at least the minimum bid for the property, which is being established as $467,750 (Updated 6/18). On the day of sale, prospective bidders will be required to furnish the auction house a certified funds (cashiers) check in the amount of $50,000 in order to be issued a bidder number. Entry to the property on sale day for \"final walk through\" will be limited to registered bidders (and up to three additional persons) that have provided such surety. A winning bidder that does not complete the sale forfeits the $50,000 to the seller without condition. Online bidders will be required to provide a $50,000 pre-authorization on a major credit card, and execute a waiver of right to chargeback or challenge a claim if one is made for non-performance of a winning bid. Property is being sold AS IS IN EVERY RESPECT. You are encouraged to inspect it as provided for above prior to sale, and to bring whatever consultants you wish to have review the property at that time. PROPERTY IS PROTECTED BY A MONITORED ALARM SYSTEM, please do not attempt to enter. Any trespass will be prosecuted. The property is served by a municipal domestic water supply system that appears to be professionally winterized, generally undamaged and should be merchantable with minor repair. The heating and cooling systems include ground water pumps and hydronic and forced air heating/cooling systems. There appears to be some freeze damage to the coils in the pump units and localized plumbing in the mechanical room. It is not possible to determine the complete operability of the system because the control systems were removed during a theft of technology systems that has rendered the system inoperable at present. A forensic report on the condition of the heating and cooling system is available upon request to the auction house", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/111209"},
{"title": "Bundle", "comments": "The parcels in this sale unit are grouped, (\"bundled\") as permitted by MCL 211.78m. Many of these include structures which contain lead based paint. Some may contain asbestos. Many are in various stages of disrepair or collapse and are considered dangerous buildings and attractive nuisance. Some may be occupied by tenants-holding-over under law. These parcels are not being offered individually. They must be purchased as a single bundle at or above the minimum bid price, if any is stated. Pursuant to MCL 211.78 (1), the Foreclosing Governmental Unit (FGU) has determined that the most efficient and expeditious method to return many of these parcels to productive use, is to require their immediate demolition, remediation, rehabilitation or repurposing if sold at auction. Many of these parcels constitute blight, a public nuisance and abatement is considered necessary. Before their sale to ANY purchaser at auction, it is the intent of the FGU that any such purchaser shall demonstrate their financial ability and willingness to perform those actions necessary, in the public interest and welfare, to bring the properties into compliance with local codes and ordinances. Therefore, it is a further requirement of sale of the bundled properties that a purchaser must demolish, remediate, rehabilitate or repurpose these properties as follows: 1) ALL STRUCTURES must be secured and made un-enterable within 15 days of sale at auction, at the purchasers sole expense, or the sale shall be cancelled and no refund or deed issued. 2) Any visible refuse, garbage, trash or other cast off shall be removed from lands within 15 days of the sale at auction, at the purchasers sole expense, or the sale shall be cancelled and no refund or deed issued.. 3) The conditions required in (1) and (2) above shall be maintained against further entry or blight for a period of 12 months following the execution of a deed. 4) Those properties in the bundle that are beyond reasonable repair or economic vitality to repair must be demolished at the sole expense of the purchaser. The cost of such work shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. All such demolition must be performed within 6 months of deeding, by a licensed, insured demolition contractor acceptable to the code official of the local unit of government where the property is located. All proper permits for demolition and the removal and disposal of volatile debris (asbestos, contaminants etc) must be obtained. 5) Those properties in the bundle which appear to either the purchaser, FGU or the code enforcement official of the local unit of government to be potentially contaminated, shall be the subject of a Baseline Environmental Assessment (BEA) at the sole expense of the purchaser. The cost of such BEA(s) shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. The BEA(s) shall be conducted by an insured environmental consultant licensed in the State of Michigan within 45 days of purchase, and shall be fully complete and filed with the proper authorities within 90 days of purchase. The level of the BEA to be conducted shall be determined by the findings of the initial phase(s) of the BEA at each parcel subject to such study. Where contamination is evident, the purchaser shall indemnify the FGU with a separate performance bond (issued on the same terms as others herein required) in an amount equal to the full cost of remediation of the contamination at each such site, and for a period of twenty (20) years, unless remediation is undertaken and completed during that time period. If the site is remediated to a level satisfactory to state officials charged with such determinations, the requirement for a performance bond shall be removed for that site. 6) Those properties in the bundle which can be rehabilitated or repurposed shall be brought into compliance with all construction, occupancy, zoning and other use codes of the local unit of government within 12 months. Construction and/or mechanical permits must be obtained prior to performing such work. Occupancy permits must be obtained by the expiration of that term. All construction and rehabilitation work at these properties shall be carried out by contractors that are licensed and insured, and acceptable to the code enforcement officer of the local unit of government. The cost of such work shall be at the sole expense of the original purchaser and shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to third parties through sale or conveyance until complete. In pursuance of those requirements and their costs and timelines, the FGU is requiring the posting of a performance bond in the amount of $1,500,000.00. The performance bond shall be made out in favor of the Office of the Jackson County Treasurer (acting as the Foreclosing Governmental Unit). Evidence of the issuance and full payment for such bond shall be presented to the FGU within fifteen (15) days of the acceptance of the purchasers bid at auction. In the event evidence of issuance and full payment is not tendered within fifteen (15) days of sale, the sale shall be cancelled outright, and the purchaser considered non-responsive to a necessary condition of the sale. No receipt for the sale shall be issued, and the bidder shall not be entitled to enter upon such premises, until such bond is issued and deemed sufficient by the FGU. Such bond shall be issued by an underwriter licensed to do business in the State of Michigan, who is not the subject of any pending disciplinary action by the State of Michigan or any department, bureau or commission thereof. It shall be payable, in full amount, to the FGU in the event of either whole or partial non-performance of the terms above written for its entire duration. It shall run as effective and be fully pre-paid, for the entire term of twenty-four (24) months. Any overage or refund shall be payable to the purchaser upon earlier termination of the bond because of full performance hereunder. This 24 month time period is not applicable to those performance bonds required for contaminated parcels noted in (5) above. The original of such bond(s) shall be held by an escrow agent satisfactory to the FGU, fully prepaid, at the expense of the purchaser. In the event any purchaser is a corporate or other entity, the principals of such entity must also execute full-recourse personal guarantees that assure payment of the amount(s) due under performance bonds in the event they are not honored for any reason. Compliance with the terms of the requirements hereof shall be at the sole discretion of the FGU", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/115306"},

Frequently homes are located on one parcel and the associated back or side-yard is located on a separate adjacent parcel. These side-yards are sometimes foreclosed while the home is not. This can create unfortunate situations where fenced boundaries, septic tanks, out buildings, garages, and other improvements that were previously associated with the home next door are sold on their own.

You should investigate the integrity of this structure(s) prior to bidding. There is evidence posted which indicates that a lender may be attempting to foreclose upon this parcel after such parcel was foreclosed for delinquent property taxes. A purchaser may encounter future contact from this lender. Tax foreclosure supersedes the rights of mortgage holders. If a mortgage holder does not foreclose upon their mortgage interest prior to tax foreclosure, their right to do so is generally lost. Typically such mortgage holders were provided all necessary notice of tax foreclosure but failed to act in a timely fashion to preserve their interest. In rare instances it may be necessary to cancel a sale if a deficiency in notice to such a lender is discovered.

{"title": "Two Story Home On 16Th Street In Otsego.", "comments": "Abandoned old house off 16th street in Otsego. This house sits on approximately 1.5 acres of land. Over all this house is in poor condition. The roof has collapsed in multiple areas and the block foundation has caved in substantially in one area of the home. This is a nice size lot in the country. Would be a nice spot to rebuild. Thick vegetation and some large trees on the property. If visiting this property in person please use caution. This building is dangerous. This building contains evidence of mold. Mold is an indication of excess moisture which can come from a variety of sources including high ground water, improper sealing of foundation walls, damaged roofs, and other conditions which can be expensive to correct. Mold can pose significant health risks and, if extensive, may require a complete renovation which could exceed the value of the building. Please conduct your own research and bid accordingly. One or more buildings on this parcel has a roof which is either leaking to the interior or appears close to failure. Failing roofs often indicate substantial structural decay inside the building. You should investigate the integrity of this structure(s) prior to bidding. This parcel has substantial structural issues caused by poor design, insufficient maintenance, or both. Such buildings may be subject to condemnation orders which we were unable to locate during our inspection. All such buildings should be brought into compliance with local building regulations prior to use.

{"title": "Acreage With Trailer On Taft Road In Allegan.", "comments": "Abandoned Trailer sits on approximately 3.92 acres of wooded land with clearing. Notices posted stating Trailer was in uninhabitable condition. There is a large amount of debris on this property including many tires. Water heater and furnace were still in the home. The breaker box was physically damaged. There were multiple structures on this property at one time but have since collapsed and turned to ruble. Overall, the trailer is in poor condition and needs attention along with the entire premise. This spacious parcel has a lot of potential. If someone comes and cleans all of the garbage and debris this property could become something real nice for a family that likes nature. This property has been subject to vandalism by former occupants or other parties. Typical damage includes broken windows, holes in walls, broken doors and doorjambs, and other damage which can add to the cost of repair and rehabilitation. You should conduct your own research prior to bidding on this parcel. This parcel has been posted as \"Condemned\" by the local building authority. Properties are generally condemned when they are deemed substandard, unsafe, or otherwise unfit for use and habitation. Condemned property must be rehabilitated to meet local building codes prior to use or occupancy. A building is not automatically slated for demolition when condemned. However, this does not necessarily mean that demolition will not also be pursued by the local unit. Please check with the local building official before bidding to determine the specific status and requirements for this property. This parcel appears to include an area where a mobile home was previously located. Such mobile home pads will frequently include well/water and septic/sewer connections as well as power hookups. However, local zoning regulations may prohibit placing a new mobile home on this site despite the fact that one was previously located here. Please check local zoning regulations carefully prior to bidding. We make no representations or warranties as to the suitability of this parcel for any purpose.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/116839"},
{"title": "Wooded Acreage With Trailer On 142Nd Ave In Dorr", "comments": "Abandoned Trailer on approximately 1.76 acres of land. A long two track driveway leads to a trailer tucked in the woods. This mobile home is accompanied with two small storage sheds on the back of the property. The home has two bedrooms, one full bathroom and an open sitting room. Personal debris was found through out the property. Mostly grassy lot with a handful of large trees. There is a swampy area near the entrance to the property. Possible wetland indicator. The trailer was in fair condition but needs to be cleaned up and repaired in a few areas. Mobile homes (and some modular homes) can be separately titled and considered personal property. In these instances, there may be third parties that have the legal right to remove that mobile home from the parcel whether or not it has been assessed as part of the property in the past. We make no representations or warranties as to whether such mobile or modular homes are included with the real property offered for sale. It is the buyer\u2019s responsibility to conduct their own research as to the state of title. As a preliminary step, it may be useful to determine if an Affidavit of Affixture of Manufactured Home has been executed and recorded as outlined in MCL 125.2330i. You may wish to consult a licensed attorney or title company to assist in this research. This parcel has surface water, soil, or vegetation conditions indicating that it may include wetland habitat. Such habitat may comprise all or part of the parcel's area. However, it is possible that this parcel contains buildable areas as well. There are many environmental and building regulations related to wetlands which you should consult before bidding on this parcel.

The house opens to a spacious living room with nice high ceilings in all the rooms on the main floor. There is a full bathroom located on both levels with washer/dryer hook ups. The basement showed signs of being a duplex. A kitchen was located on both levels of the house. There was a sliding door entrance to the basement from the backyard. The plumbing had stickers stating it had been winterized. The garage had a nice workshop room attached to the car port. The car port opens to another perpendicular car port. This house looks to be in good condition and would need little work to be livable. We don't get many houses that look this nice.", "link": "https://www.tax-sale.info/lot/show/id/115467"},

However, some parcels also contain personal property such as cars, furniture, clothing, and other things which aren't physically attached to the land. Such personal property is not included as part of this sale. It is strongly suggested that the purchaser of this parcel contact the former owner and provide them the opportunity to remove this personal property before disposing of it. Minimum reasonable steps could include sending a letter by certified and first class mail to the former owner at their last known address.

Overall condition is fair, but unlike most converted structures this sits on a very large lot with room for parking . Check with local zoning for approved uses. Property uses which don't conform to current zoning regulations may be permissible if grandfathered in. However, once such a non-conforming use ceases, that grandfathered status is often lost. This can include the use of mobile homes, multi-family construction, and other property uses which are no longer allowed by local zoning regulations. You should confirm with local zoning officials that your intended use of this property is allowed prior to bidding. The building on this property appears to have been used for multi-family occupancy in the past based upon indicators such as multiple mailboxes, entrances, numbering, layout, or other such factors. Modifications to the property may NOT have been legally made and may NOT conform to local zoning. Prospective bidders should verify with local officials that multi-family use is permitted under existing zoning.

This lot is part of a condominium development. A condominium is a form of land ownership which is divided up into individual \"units.\" Owners are required to be part of the applicable condominium association (COA) which includes rules and regulations related to the use and ownership of each unit. Additional restrictions will be spelled out in the development's master deed. Condominiums also include association fees which can be significant. Some condominium units delegate things like exterior maintenance and repair to the COA whereas the owner remains responsible for the unit's interior. However, there are many varieties of condominiums including residential and commercial interior space, condo subdivision lots, condo boat slips, condo campsites and others. Prospective bidders should carefully review and understand the master deed, COA rules and regulations, and investigate association fees prior to bidding. This parcel is likely subject to ASSOCIATION FEES which are assessed to cover maintenance and other costs associated with the development in which the parcel is located.
